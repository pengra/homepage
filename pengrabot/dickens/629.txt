A template for specifying a 3-state, 2-color Turing machine is shown above using a form of notation due to Wolfram (2002). In this figure, a state is represented by a square containing a pointer indicating any of three possible directions; the property of 'color' is represented by the color of the square; and an instruction is represented by two squares in a column, with the top one representing a possible color and state of the active cell and the bottom one giving the new state and color of the active cell together with the direction the tape should be moved. The special state 0 (with no pointer) indicates a state at which the Turing machine should halt, i.e., cease computation. The #1 tool for creating Demonstrations and anything technical.
