This is the top level of the kernel’s documentation tree.  Kernel documentation, like the kernel itself, is very much a work in progress; that is especially true as we work to integrate our many scattered documents into a coherent whole.  Please note that improvements to the documentation are welcome; join the linux-doc list at vger.kernel.org if you want to help out. The following describes the license of the Linux kernel source code (GPLv2), how to properly mark the license of individual files in the source tree, as well as links to the full license text. The user-space API manual gathers together documents describing aspects of the kernel interface as seen by application developers. These manuals contain overall information about how to develop the kernel. The kernel community is quite large, with thousands of developers contributing over the course of a year.  As with any large community, knowing how things are done will make the process of getting your changes merged much easier. These books provide programming details about architecture-specific implementation. The documentation in this section are provided by specific filesystem subprojects. © Copyright The kernel development community.
