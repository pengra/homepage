But the SEC’s new filing seeks to draw a distinction between that statement—what it calls a “cryptic reference” that, it notes, confused some analysts—and the company's official guidance submitted to shareholders. It argues Musk should have gotten approval before disseminating that information, even by tweet, because it was new. The SEC filing also addresses the Musk legal team’s contention that its enforcement of the settlement is a violation of the CEO’s First Amendment right to free speech. Tesla, not the SEC, would be the party reviewing Musk’s communications for truthfulness, the SEC argues. So “no First Amendment concern exists given that Musk’s speech is to be reviewed by … a private actor, and not the government.” Nearly half a million people have put down a thousand dollar deposit for a Tesla Model 3 they may not get for years. But once the early production bugs are ironed out, the Model 3 feels like it's going to be a great everyday car. CNMN Collection © 2018 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.
