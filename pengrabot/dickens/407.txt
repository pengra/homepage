Confused about pricing of Tesla cars and features? Get ready to get even more confused. Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed that Autopilot pricing is "reverting to normal" — meaning the prices go back up after they've been lowered recently — next Monday. Now, Tesla is backpedaling on that decision as well. In a tweet Tuesday, Musk said that the "lower price shouldn't have been offered" in the first place. "Was done so because some simply couldn't afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday," he wrote. In retrospect, lower price shouldn’t have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldn’t afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday. The silver lining is that people who have a Tesla car eligible for the upgrades, and haven't bought them, can still take advantage of the reduced prices before Monday. However, Tesla's back and forth on pricing for both the cars and the extra features has been horribly confusing. Let's hope the company will keep things a bit more simple and straightforward from now on.
