This app is only available on the App Store for iOS devices. Works very well. I just have 1 thing to say. In the app, the section where the function history is shown seems far too large. And the buttons are too small. Perhaps you could implement some features in other calculators to fix this. For example, some calculators have you swipe down from the answer bar to view your function history. Also, there seems to be no way of using subscript like on the computer version. Although it is present in the graphing calculator app. Also, the median function is missus in this app where it is present in the graphing calculator app. And I would like to suggest a function for the mode of a set of data. I love this calculator and use it all the time. I was wondering if you could add a feature that gives us the ability to save things to memory though. Whenever I close the app everything is lost. Every other calculator app has ads, this one doesnâ€™t! One suggestion though is make the keypad bigger. All that open space at the top is a waste of real estate. Requires iOS 9.0 or later. Compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. English With Family Sharing set up, up to six family members can use this app.
