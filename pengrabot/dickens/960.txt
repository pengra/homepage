Let's derive the relevant formula: if our blind guess for a root of $f$ is $x_o$, then the tangent line is $$y-f(x_o)=f'(x_o)(x-x_o)$$ ‘Sliding down’ the tangent line to hit the $x$-axis means to find the intersection of this line with the $x$-axis: this is where $y=0$. Thus, we solve for $x$ in $$0-f(x_o)=f'(x_o)(x-x_o)$$ to find $$x=x_o-{f(x_o)\over f'(x_o)}$$ It is important to realize that there is some uncertainty in Newton's method, both because it alone cannot assure that we have a root, and also because the idea just described for approximating roots to a given accuracy is not foolproof. But to worry about what could go wrong here is counter-productive. Continuing with this example: $f(0)=1>0$, so since $f(1) < 0$ we know by the intermediate value theorem that there is a root in $[0,1]$, since $f(1)=-1 < 0$. So as our blind gues let's use the midpoint of this interval to start Newton's Method: that is, now take $x_o=0.5$: $$\matrix{ x_{1}&=&0.33333333333333337034\cr  x_{2}&=&0.3472222222222222654\cr  x_{3}&=&0.34729635316386797683\cr  x_{4}&=&0.34729635533386071788\cr  x_{5}&=&0.34729635533386060686\cr  x_{6}&=&0.34729635533386071788\cr  x_{7}&=&0.34729635533386060686\cr  x_{8}&=&0.34729635533386071788 }$$ so we have a root evidently approximated to $3$ decimal places after just $2$ applications of Newton's method. After $8$ applications, we have apparently $15$ correct decimal places. Keywords: derivative, ordinary derivative, roots
