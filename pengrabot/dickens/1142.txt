It’s the easiest way to experience everything Disrupt SF 2019 has to offer and save a bundle in the process. Need a reminder of what you’ll find at TechCrunch Disrupt? Let’s start with the speakers. We’re building an outstanding lineup of leading founders, technologists, investors and tech icons. Past speakers have included people such as Whitney Wolfe-Herd, founder of Bumble, Tristan Walker, CEO of Walker & Company Brands and Aileen Lee, founder of Cowboy Ventures. Looking for more excitement? Look no further than the TechCrunch Hackathon. This event takes place right alongside Disrupt. Several hundred developers, engineers, students and makers will form ad-hoc teams. Over the course of two days, they’ll code, crack and hack non-stop to create a new product. It’ll require focused determination and mad skills to win best overall hack — along with plenty of coffee, Red Bull and pizza. Come strut your dev stuff and compete in sponsored contests for cash, prizes and TechCrunch swag.
