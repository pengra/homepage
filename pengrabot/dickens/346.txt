Glad to see that the Open Dylan project has released binaries recently.  If you don't mind, a few questions... Does the the warning below mean that the 32 bit version of the Open Dylan IDE DOES work on 64 bit Windows 8 and later versions of 64 bit Windows? Is there a 64 bit version of Open Dylan and the Open Dylan IDE for Windows as a binary release? Is there a 64 bit version of Open Dylan and the Open Dylan IDE for Windows as a source code release? Warning The 32 bit version of Open Dylan IDE does NOT work on 64 bit Windows prior to Windows 8. There is no workaround at this time, unfortunately. We hope to resolve this in an upcoming release. However, the command line tools should work as the problem is with interaction between threads, GC and WoW64. Yes, the 32-bit version of the IDE works on 64-bit Windows 10. I can't swear that it works on Windows 8 as I don't think it was tested there for this release.  Let us know!  I'll see if I can clarify that warning message on the web site. Thank you. Too bad the IDE is not available on Linux.  Do you know if it works on Linux using Wine? https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=37522 There is not yet a 64-bit Windows version of the IDE. The LLVM back-end should make this possible, just as it has the 64-bit versions of Linux and FreeBSD, but a bit more work is needed. WebAssembly  will probably be a great platform to target in the future, but features such as garbage collection and the other "post-MVP features" aren't ready yet. When these things are more mature we can consider pursuing it. Wow, I haven't seen anything about Dylan since Creatures 3 was new... Such a neglected language. Shame though because it's nice. 90 Subscribers 7 Online News about Open Dylan and other things in the Dylan programming community.
