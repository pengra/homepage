During installation, all of the registry entries and paths needed to make the thing work are put in place flawlessly. You can also customize the heck out of the editor by tinkering with the 'config.txt' file and re-launching. Execution is fast, debugging and tracing are good enough for intermediate level and above programmers to figure out the deal.  Lots of features, but you need to take the time to find them. Cons The tutorial that comes with this package is very good - start typing!
