School of Music University of Northern Colorado's School of Music is a vibrant and vital community                      of musical performers, composers, scholars, and educators. Along with Music History and Literature, the Department of Music Theory forms the                            academic backbone for all music degrees at UNC. Every music student must demonstrate                            a high level of proficiency in music theory and aural skills as essential tools for                            a 21st-century musician. All undergraduate and graduate music theory courses are taught by faculty members.                            Undergraduate music students master a core sequence that includes aural skills, sight-singing,                            voice-leading, form & analysis, and 20th-21st century materials. Outstanding students                            of music theory have the opportunity to take graduate theory courses and have published                            their research in UNC's Undergraduate Research Journal; several of our students have                            gone on to pursue music theory at the graduate level. Graduate students select from                            a variety of courses in tonal and post-tonal theory as well as Music Theory Seminars                            featuring specialized topics. The area of Music Theory offers a secondary emphasis                            within the Doctor of Arts degree, which includes a focus on music theory pedagogy.
