This question already has an answer here: What's a clean and efficient JavaScript implementation to strip leading and trailing spaces from a string? For example: " dog" "dog " " dog " "           dog " all get turned into "dog" Use this: The trim function will now be available as a first-class function on your strings.  For example: Took Matthew Crumley's idea about sniffing on the trim function prior to recreating it.  This is done in case the version of JavaScript used on the client is more recent and therefore has its own, native trim function.
