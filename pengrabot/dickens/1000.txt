Some Blackboard Collaborate Ultra users may experience a large number of disconnection events, affecting moderators and participants alike, that significantly disrupt the session. The vendor is aware of the intermittent issue and is taking steps to prepare and apply a fix. The session moderator may try to exit and relaunch the session to see if that resolves the issue or may need to use an alternate web conferencing solution (e.g., Collaborate Original, WebEx, etc.)  if the problematic behavior persists.
