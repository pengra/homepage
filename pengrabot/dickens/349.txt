We note that the part in square brackets [] is an exact differential Similarly we have We consider the case of a second derivative by performing integration by parts yields A second application of integration by parts applied to the integral on the right hand side yields Rewriting so that the integral terms are on the left and the integrated terms are on the right, we obtain the familiar form of Green's theorem Such discussions are pertinent for many mathematical physics problems. The governing equation may be the Laplace equation, the Poisson equation, the heat or diffusion equation, or some form of the wave equation. Many mathematical physics problems are governed by second order partial differential operators. The governing equation may be the Laplace equation, the Poisson equation, the heat or diffusion equation, the Schroedinger equation, or some form of the wave equation. and and note that and thus We may write, using this identity that Similarly, we may write and thus, and substituting, we have: Rearranging terms, we obtain Applying the Divergence Theorem to the right hand side yields the familiar form of Green's theorem which allows us to write A typical physical sciences problem involves a second order partial differential equation, with boundary conditions. We may use Green's theorem to solve such problems. Examples of self-adjoint operators are the Laplace and Poisson operators. A number of operators may be Fourier transformed in time to yield self-adjoint representations. These include the Schroedinger operator, the heat or diffusion operator, the scalar wave equation, and the Navier (elastic) wave equation. Here the integrand of the volume integral is an exact divergence
