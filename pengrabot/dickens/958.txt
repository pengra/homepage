 Suppose you have a function $f(x)$, and you want to find as accurately as possible where it crosses the $x$-axis; in other words, you want to solve $f(x)=0$.  Suppose you know of no way to find an exact solution by any algebraic procedure, but you are able to use an approximation, provided it can be made quite close to the true value. Newton's method is a way to find a solution to the equation to as many decimal places as you want.  It is what is called an "iterative procedure,'' meaning that it can be repeated again and again to get an answer of greater and greater accuracy.  Iterative procedures like Newton's method are well suited to programming for a computer. Newton's method uses the fact that the tangent line to a curve is a good approximation to the curve near the point of tangency.     Let's think about this process in more general terms. We want to approximate a solution to $f(x)=0$. We start with a rough guess, which we call $\ds x_0$.  We use the tangent line to $f(x)$ to get a new approximation that we hope will be closer to the true value. What is the equation of the tangent line when $\ds x=x_0$? The slope is $\ds f'(x_0)$ and the line goes through $\ds(x_0,f(x_0))$, so the equation of the line is $$ y=f'(x_0)(x-x_0)+f(x_0).$$ Now we find where this crosses the $x$-axis by substituting $y=0$ and solving for $x$: $$x={x_0f'(x_0)-f(x_0)\over f'(x_0)} = x_0 - {f(x_0)\over f'(x_0)}.$$ We will typically want to compute more than one of these improved approximations, so we number them consecutively; from $\ds x_0$ we have computed $\ds x_1$: $$x_1={x_0f'(x_0)-f(x_0)\over f'(x_0)} = x_0 - {f(x_0)\over f'(x_0)},$$ and in general from $\ds x_i$ we compute $\ds x_{i+1}$: $$x_{i+1}={x_if'(x_i)-f(x_i)\over f'(x_i)} = x_i - {f(x_i)\over f'(x_i)}.$$   In practice, which is to say, if you need to approximate a value in the course of designing a bridge or a building or an airframe, you will need to have some confidence that the approximation you settle on is accurate enough. As a rule of thumb, once a certain number of decimal places stop changing from one approximation to the next it is likely that those decimal places are correct. Still, this may not be enough assurance, in which case we can test the result for accuracy.
