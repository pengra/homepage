Customers of Spark, Vocus, or Vodaphone may have difficulty accessing sites known for hosting objectionable material and which actively helped to mirror the 17 minutes of real-time murder footage after it had been pulled from Facebook. The blocked sites include imageboards 4chan and 8chan. The latter, a site which exists largely for those who believe 4chan itself is too heavily censored, is where the gunman initially published his manifesto. Advertisement Gizmodo was not able to independently verify claims that other sites, like file-sharing service Mega, video hosts LiveLeak and BitChute, caching tool Archive.is, and Kiwifarms have also become inaccessible to New Zealand customers. Either way, the blocks are believed to be temporary. Advertisement Many imageboards—8chan among them—host deepweb mirrors accessible via the Tor browser, and the blocked sites may still be available to New Zealanders through the use of a VNP. The footage was initially streamed to Facebook Live, and it spread via YouTube, Twitter, and Reddit, none of which have been claimed to be blocked, so it’s unclear how effective this blockade will be at preventing New Zealanders from seeing the footage.
