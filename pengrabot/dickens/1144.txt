If hashtags were votes, Yang would have already won Focusing purely on tweets related to blockchain and cryptocurrency, Yang has garnered 75 percent of the interaction total, proving his effectiveness at capturing the attention of decentralized tech fans. In it, Yang declared himself a fan of blockchain‘s “underlying technology,” and said cryptocurrency could be critical in creating a “digital-social currency.” “Amateur economists” have even made a handy infographic displaying how Yang Bucks (in combination with Bitcoin) are poised to fuel a self-sustaining economy that’s supposed to protect against “AI & robots & shit.” Regardless, neither Kasich or Delaney have enjoyed as much engagement as Yang. While there have been efforts to squeeze “blockchain” into social media feeds, Yang is the only one to find true success by discussing decentralization. Seriously, Yang almost hit 300,000 Twitter interactions last month, while Kasich and Delaney currently average just 21,000. Using social monitoring tool CrowdTangle, Hard Fork also looked into the most prominent “Yang Gang influencers.” By analyzing tweets with #YangGang and #YangGang2020 hashtags, we’ve ranked authors by interaction volume (their influence). The 2020 elections are still a year-and-a-half away, but consider that Yang’s rise in popularity was incredibly sudden (and super hilarious). With so long left in the race, it’s probable the Yang Gang is yet to reach its final form, but it’s definitely wising up to its potential. #YangGang2020 Published March 21, 2019 — 17:13 UTC March 21, 2019 — 17:13 UTC The Heart of Tech™ Thank you!
