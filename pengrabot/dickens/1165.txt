Execute Firefox 66. Its hot new feature: automatically blocking autoplaying video with sound. Videos that autoplay on mute by default won’t be affected by Firefox’s block, so it’s clear that Mozilla is focusing on specific types of videos that go out of their way to annoy users. Videos that autoplay after you finish watching a previous video, like on YouTube or Netflix, also won’t be affected by the block. The latest version of Firefox also puts an end to another scourge of the web: websites that jump around thanks to slow loading images and advertisements. Firefox 66 introduces a scroll anchoring feature which basically locks where you are on a webpage in place. This way the page doesn’t automatically scroll down while you're reading an article because an annoying banner ad just loaded at the top of a website. Another feature added to Firefox with this update is a new search box which allows users to scan through all of their open tabs. Firefox 66 also delivers other search improvements, updated security warnings, support for Windows Hello on Windows 10, as well as finally adding basic support for the MacOS touch bar.
