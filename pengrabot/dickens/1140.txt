There’s nothing like a Disrupt conference, and our San Francisco event — which takes place October 2-4 — promises to be an epic record-breaker. Attendance is set to exceed last year’s 10,000+ crowd, and we’re hard at work building a stellar lineup of speakers, panelists, demos, Q&A Sessions and workshops. Make sure to explore Startup Alley while you’re there — Disrupt’s exhibition floor and home to hundreds of early-stage startups showing their latest tech innovations. You’ll find a range of technologies with a focus on these tracks: Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, Blockchain, Biotech/Healthtech, Fintech, Gaming, Mobility, Privacy/Security, E-commerce, Robotics and more. The ever-popular TechCrunch Hackathon returns to Disrupt SF this year, running in tandem with the conference. Over the course of two days, hundreds of uber-talented hackers, software engineers, devs, students and makers of many stripes will form ad-hoc teams and compete to create new products. Along with the main event, there will be plenty of sponsored hack contests, prizes, cash and swag. It’s exhausting, demanding and fun — and a great way to show your stuff to an influential crowd.
