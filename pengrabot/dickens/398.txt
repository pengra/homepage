I had dismissed Vala as a GNOME thing with little interest to those outside the GNOME community, but recently I had seen Vala pop up in a few unexpected places, so I decided to give it a closer look. Nor do I really care that much about module counts. Your language may have four different libraries to parse JSON and multiple ORMs, but what I want to know is what are people building with those libraries. If people are building cool projects with a language, I think a strong ecosystem and useful libraries will follow. I realize GitHub might not host all the cool things being done in a language, but I feel it is representative. Maybe cool things are being done in a language but they are proprietary. If a language is fun to use, I think it will be used for both proprietary and open source projects, so I think open source projects sufficient to judge a language. There could also be cool projects on SourceForge, GitLab, etc. For now, GitHub has by far the largest collection of open source projects, so it serves to give a pretty good survey of what is available in a given language. I guess since I do have Vala in the title, I should share some of the cool projects being built with Vala that convinced me to give it a closer look. Vala may not have developers who "rewrite all the things" like Rust or the backing of a tech giant like Go and Reason. I've been averaging a new programming language every seven years, so this is a big decision. I'm taking my time. I'm considering making Rust or D my next language, but now I'm also considering Vala.
