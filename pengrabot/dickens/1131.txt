Answer Zuck's call The firm wants a “proactive team player” that will support the company‘s new initiative into the development of blockchain-based applications. I sincerely hope this doesn’t mean Farmville is getting put on the blockchain. The successful applicant will be responsible for drafting contracts and providing legal advice to Facebook‘s blockchain initiatives. Facebook provides a detailed list of requirements that applicants should meet. These include holding a graduate-level Juris Doctor degree, having over five years of legal experience and over four years experience of working at or for technology companies. If that wasn’t enough, applicants must also hold membership in at least one state bar. Facebook‘s interests in blockchain and cryptocurrency are no longer a secret, so while these hirings are interesting indicators of where Facebook might be taking its blockchain projects, they are not as surprising as they would have been this time last year.
