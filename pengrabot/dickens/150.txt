COBOL is an excellent language to start with as it was designed to be easily read using English-like syntax.  It's also got one of the most developed tooling, testing and debugging ecosystems after over half a century of field-testing. COBOL remains in high-demand in the job marketplace - according to a 1999 Gartner study, 95% of finance and insurance data is processed with COBOL and 50% of all new mission-critical apps are still being developed in COBOL. COBOL's simple to read language and syntax means that it's easy to get started solving business problems rather than focus on the implementation details.  Instead of having to deal with data types, pointers, memory management and complex symbology, developers can immediately solve problems rather than focus on the language. Business Oriented (it's part of the name): 75% of the world's business data is in COBOL.  There are 180-200 billion lines of COBOL in use worldwide and an investment of over $5 trillion in COBOL development.  If the Internet were the veins of the modern digital world then COBOL is the pumping heart keeping it all flowing. Long after your Rails app server crashes and your Node.js app event loop stalls, COBOL will still continue processing the transaction demands of the modern economy.  IBM's recent z13 mainframe can handle 2.5 Billion transactions per day (~30,000 transactions per second) - the equivalent of 100 Cyber Mondays every day.
