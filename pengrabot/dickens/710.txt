The Java Tutorials have been written for JDK 8. Examples and practices described in this page don't take advantage of improvements introduced in later releases. The sections listed below provide detailed instructions for compiling and running a simple "Hello World!" application. The first section provides information on getting started with the NetBeans IDE, an integrated development environment that greatly simplifies the software development process. The NetBeans IDE runs on all of the platforms listed below. The remaining sections provide platform-specific instructions for getting started without an integrated development environment. If you run into problems, be sure to consult the common problems section; it provides solutions for many issues encountered by new users. Copyright Â© 1995, 2017 Oracle and/or its affiliates.
