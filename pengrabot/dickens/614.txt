Samples: The sample data 						that is linked to below is taken completely at random from each of the corpora (usually about 1/100th the total number of 						texts). No attempt has been made to "clean up" this sample data in any way. If you're happy with the sample data that you download, you should be equally as happy with the full data. Note that the size shown 						in the first column is the total amount of words that 						you can download, after purchasing the data. The size in 						the other three columns is for the samples. Note also that the shared 						files below (sources and lexicon) are just for the 						sample texts.
