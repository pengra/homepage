The startups move to Silicon Valley for 3 months, during which we work intensively with them to get the company into the best possible shape and refine their pitch to investors. Each cycle culminates in Demo Day, when the startups present their companies to a carefully selected, invite-only audience. But YC doesn't end on Demo Day. We and the YC alumni network continue to help founders for the life of their company, and beyond. "Y Combinator is the best program for creating top-end entrepreneurs that has ever existed." "I doubt that Stripe would have worked without YC. It's that simple. Acquiring early customers, figuring out who to hire, closing deals with banks, raising money -- YC's partners were closely involved and crucially helpful." "I've been fortunate to engage with the YC community at past events over the last few years, and always walk away impressed with the passion and caliber of talent that YC brings together."
