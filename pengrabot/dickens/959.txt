Since f(a) = 0 and assuming (a - x)² f ''(γ)/2 is small relative to the first term, we may write In other words, This suggests an iterative process: The applet below helps visualize the process. Newton's iterations do not always converge. For example, they may loop up in a vicinity of a local extreme: showing that the error estimate on an iteration is proportional to the square of a similar estimate on the previous iteration. Assuming that the iterates do congregate towards the root and relying on the continuity of both f ' and f '' around a, we approximate so that This leads to Thus, to insure convergence of the iterations, we need or, after simplifications, Next, And In Java double precision the iterations appear as: In a similar way, taking f(x) = x² - N yields
