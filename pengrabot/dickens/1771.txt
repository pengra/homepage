Each group has its own limit, which applies to the total of all     API calls in that group. Most of the Google+ API follows a RESTful API design, meaning that you use     standard HTTP methods to retrieve and manipulate resources.  For example,     to get the profile of a user, you might send an HTTP request like: Different API methods require parameters to be passed either as part of       the URL path or as query parameters.  Additionally, there are a few       parameters that are common to all API endpoints.  These are all passed as       optional query parameters. Resources in the Google+ API are represented using JSON data formats. For     example, retrieving a user's profile may result in a response like: While each type of resource will have its own unique representation, there       are a number of common properties that are found in almost all resource       representations. Note that the response is a JSON object that includes only the selected     fields and their enclosing parent objects. Whenever a nested field is returned, the response includes the               enclosing parent objects. The parent fields do not include any               other child fields unless they are also selected explicitly. Last updated December 7, 2018.
