A JavaScript string stores a series of characters like "John Doe". A string can be any text inside double or single quotes: String indexes are zero-based: The first character is in position 0, the  second in 1, and so on. Primitive values, like "John Doe", cannot have properties  or methods (because they are not objects). But with JavaScript, methods and properties are also available to  primitive values, because JavaScript treats primitive values  as objects when executing methods and properties. All string methods return a new value. They do not change the original  variable. The HTML wrapper methods return the string wrapped inside the appropriate  HTML tag. These are not standard methods, and may not work as  expected in all browsers. Your message has been sent to W3Schools.
