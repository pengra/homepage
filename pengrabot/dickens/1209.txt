Input variables of lambda expressions are strongly typed at compile time. When the compiler can infer the types of input variables, like in the preceding example, you may omit type declarations. If you need to specify the type of input variables, you must do that for each variable, as the following example shows: The following example shows how to define a lambda expression without input variables: An expression body definition has the following general syntax: It's a shorthand version of the following method definition: Expression body definitions for methods and read-only properties are supported starting with C# 6. Expression body definitions for constructors, finalizers, property accessors, and indexers are supported starting with C# 7.0. Send feedback about: Loading feedback...
