In Alan Turing’s 1936 paper on computable numbers,                   he presented a thought experiment. Turing describes a machine                   that has an infinitely long tape upon which it writes, reads                   and alters symbols. He further shows that a machine with the                   correct minimal set of operations can calculate anything that                 is computable, no matter the complexity. My                   goal in building this project was to create a machine that                   embodied the classic look and feel of the machine presented                 in Turing’s paper. I wanted to build a machine that would                 be immediately recognizable as a Turing machine to someone familiar                 with Turing's work. The heart of the turing machine is the read-write head. The                   read-write head transports the tape and positions cells of                   the tape appropriately. It can read a cell determining what,                   if any, symbol is written there. The machine works on, and                   knows about, only one cell at a time. The tape in my machine                   is a 1000’ roll of white 35mm film leader. The characters,                   ones and zeros, are written by the machine with a black dry                 erase marker. While I have taken some liberty with a number of terms and                   concepts, I hope you can see just how simple the rules that                   drive a Turing machine are. Changing ones to zeros, moving                   one cell to the left or right, these concepts are simple, yet                   they can compute anything that is computable. And from                   these simple concepts, the most complex computers of today                   are born.  This classic biography of the founder of computer science, reissued on the centenary of his birth with a substantial new preface by the author, is the definitive account of an extraordinary mind and life. The book focuses on a small group of men and women, who built one of the first computers to realize Alan Turingâs vision of a Universal Machine. A Beginner's Guide to Parallel Processing walks you through the essential skills you need to build and control devices using the Propeller chip and its parallel processing environment.
