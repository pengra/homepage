The Newtonâ€“Raphson method in one variable is implemented as follows: The process is repeated as until a sufficiently accurate value is reached. If the first derivative is not well behaved in the neighborhood of a particular root, the method may overshoot, and diverge from that root. An example of a function with one root, for which the derivative is not well behaved in the neighborhood of the root, is In a robust implementation of Newton's method, it is common to place limits on the number of iterations, bound the solution to an interval known to contain the root, and combine the method with a more robust root finding method. where However, even linear convergence is not guaranteed in pathological situations.                 one finds that That is,     Taking absolute value of both sides gives     Newton's method is only guaranteed to converge if certain conditions are satisfied. If the assumptions made in the proof of quadratic convergence are met, the method will converge. For the following subsections, failure of the method to converge indicates that the assumptions made in the proof were not met. Consider the function: The same issue occurs if, instead of the starting point, any iteration point is stationary. Even if the derivative is small but not zero, the next iteration will be a far worse approximation. For some functions, some starting points may enter an infinite cycle, preventing convergence. Let If the function is not continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of the root then it is possible that Newton's method will always diverge and fail, unless the solution is guessed on the first try. If the derivative is not continuous at the root, then convergence may fail to occur in any neighborhood of the root. Consider the function Its derivative is: In some cases the iterates converge but do not converge as quickly as promised. In these cases simpler methods converge just as quickly as Newton's method. If the first derivative is zero at the root, then convergence will not be quadratic. Let So convergence is not quadratic, even though the function is infinitely differentiable everywhere. Similar problems occur even when the root is only "nearly" double. For example, let it takes six iterations to reach a point where the convergence appears to be quadratic. If there is no second derivative at the root, then convergence may fail to be quadratic. Let Then And which is just Newton's method as before. Then define Newton's iteration is Therefore, Newton's iteration needs only two multiplications and one subtraction. For example, if one wishes to find the square root of 612, this is equivalent to finding the solution to The function to use in Newton's method is then with derivative With an initial guess of 10, the sequence given by Newton's method is where the correct digits are underlined. With only a few iterations one can obtain a solution accurate to many decimal places.
