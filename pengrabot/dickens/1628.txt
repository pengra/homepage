GitHub is home to over 31 million developers working together to host and review code, manage projects, and build software together. I don't have any particular plans other than to review pull requests as quickly as possible. If merging the other one first makes this implementation simpler, that sounds like a good thing. Could you check the SQL spec if "RETURNING id" for multiple rows is something other databases could support too? If yes, the code should get moved into the standard insert compiler and if no, you can at least drop part of the if statements, since you know that those flags will be true in pg always. I don't like the duplication of code done here. Could we instead branch on database feature in the main compiler class? Sounds reasonable, I'll change it as requested. Requested change applied, some code cleaned up. Tests are passing fine now, there were some problems with previous commit. This won't be backported to 1.9. use a more descriptive name use a single line or use hanging indent (we avoid non-4 space indents) single line as above .. versionchanged:: 1.10 returns->return (use PEP257 verb style for new docstrings) except if features.can_return_ids_from_bulk_insert=True unless the database backend supports it (currently PostgreSQL). PostgreSQL Thanks!
