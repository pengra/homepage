 Note that this does indeed describe the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: to compute a single integral over an interval, we do a computation on the boundary (the endpoints) that involves one fewer integrations, namely, no integrations at all.   We already know one case, not particularly interesting, in which this theorem is true: If $\bf F$ is conservative, we know that the integral $\ds\oint_C {\bf F}\cdot d{\bf r}=0$, because any integral of a conservative vector field around a closed curve is zero. We also know in this case that $\partial P/\partial y=\partial Q/\partial x$, so the double integral  in the theorem is simply the integral of the zero function, namely, 0. So in the case that $\bf F$ is conservative, the theorem says simply that $0=0$.  Starting with the double integral: $$\dint{D} y-0\,dA=\int_0^1\int_0^{1-x} y\,dy\,dx= \int_0^1 {(1-x)^2\over2}\,dx=\left.-{(1-x)^3\over6}\right|_0^1={1\over6}.$$ There is no single formula to describe the boundary of $D$, so to compute the left side directly we need to compute three separate integrals corresponding to the three sides of the triangle, and each of these integrals we break into two integrals, the "$dx$'' part and the "$dy$'' part. The three sides are described by $y=0$, $y=1-x$, and $x=0$. The integrals are then $$\eqalign{ \int_{\partial D}\!\!\! x^4\,dx + xy\,dy&= \int_0^1 x^4\,dx+\int_0^0 0\,dy+\int_1^0 x^4\,dx+\int_0^1 (1-y)y\,dy+ \int_0^0 0\,dx+\int_1^0 0\,dy\cr &={1\over5}+0-{1\over5}+{1\over6}+0+0={1\over6}.\cr} $$ Alternately, we could describe the three sides in vector form as $\langle t,0\rangle$, $\langle 1-t,t\rangle$, and $\langle 0,1-t\rangle$. Note that in each case, as $t$ ranges from 0 to 1, we follow the corresponding side in the correct direction. Now $$\eqalign{ \int_{\partial D} x^4\,dx + xy\,dy&= \int_0^1 t^4 + t\cdot 0\,dt + \int_0^1 -(1-t)^4 + (1-t)t\,dt +\int_0^1 0 + 0\,dt\cr &=\int_0^1 t^4\,dt + \int_0^1 -(1-t)^4 + (1-t)t\,dt ={1\over6}.\cr }$$  In this case, none of the integrations are difficult, but the second approach is somewhat tedious because of the necessity to set up three different integrals. In different circumstances, either of the integrals, the single or the double, might be easier to compute. Sometimes it is worthwhile to turn a single integral into the corresponding double integral, sometimes exactly the opposite approach is best. Here is a clever use of Green's Theorem: We know that areas can be computed using double integrals, namely, $$\dint{D} 1\,dA$$ computes the area of region $D$. If we can find $P$ and $Q$ so that $\partial Q/\partial x-\partial P/\partial y=1$, then the area is also $$\int_{\partial D} P\,dx+Q\,dy.$$ It is quite easy to do this: $P=0,Q=x$ works, as do $P=-y, Q=0$ and $P=-y/2,Q=x/2$.    For the first equation, we start with $$\dint{D}{\partial P\over\partial y}\,dA= \int_a^b\int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} {\partial P\over \partial y}\,dy\,dx= \int_a^b P(x,g_2(x))-P(x,g_1(x))\,dx.$$ Here we have simply used the ordinary Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, since for the inner integral we are integrating a derivative with respect to $y$: an antiderivative of $\partial P/\partial y$ with respect to $y$ is simply $P(x,y)$, and then we substitute $g_1$ and $g_2$ for $y$ and subtract. Now we need to manipulate $\oint_C P\,dx$. The boundary of region $D$ consists of 4 parts, given by the equations $y=g_1(x)$, $x=b$, $y=g_2(x)$, and $x=a$. On the portions $x=b$ and $x=a$, $dx=0\,dt$, so the corresponding integrals are zero. For the other two portions, we use the parametric forms $x=t$, $y=g_1(t)$, $a\le t\le b$, and $x=t$, $y=g_2(t)$, letting $t$ range from $b$ to $a$, since we are integrating counter-clockwise around the boundary. The resulting integrals give us $$\eqalign{ \oint_C P\,dx = \int_a^b P(t,g_1(t))\,dt+\int_b^a P(t,g_2(t))\,dt &=\int_a^b P(t,g_1(t))\,dt-\int_a^b P(t,g_2(t))\,dt\cr &=\int_a^b P(t,g_1(t))-P(t,g_2(t))\,dt\cr }$$ which is the result of the double integral times $-1$, as desired. The equation involving $Q$ is essentially the same, and left as an exercise.
