Do not the Wikileaks texts suit you? You probably want the "All pages, current versions only."-version. If recency is not an issue, you can try http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/20-newsgroups-dataset-de-duped-version and there are other many more similar dataset in infochimp depending on your budget.
