Underachievers need not apply Ripple appears to be the only company from the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector to make the list. Though it should be noted that firms have to pay for GPTW services, so this might have something to do with it. Other (non-blockchain) tech firms did feature list of 35 SME businesses in the Bay area, though, including the familiar SurveyMonkey. The list of large companies was topped by hotel chain, Hilton, alongside which household tech names like Cisco, Adobe, Dropbox, and NVIDIA also featured. To be eligible for the list, companies must open their doors to researchers from Good Place to Work (GTPW) and allow their staff to be surveyed. Companies with less than 999 employees – like Ripple – are classed as small to medium enterprises. While those firms with over 1,000 employees are put head to head with other “large” companies. GPTW considers a range of metrics when putting their scores together, but it is mostly based on employee feedback. The GPTW methodology states that employees are faced with 60 questions which focus on how good it is to work where they do. As I mentioned a company must pay for GPTW’s services before becoming certified, it has to meet a number of prerequisites set out by Good Place to Work. Naturally, a company isn’t going to pursue certification unless they believe they’ll get a strong score; and if it doesn’t meet the prerequisites it can’t be certified and won’t feature on any list. So take it all with a pinch of salt, and spare a thought for the employees at companies that aren’t mentioned.
