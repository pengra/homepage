The original string is left unchanged. A new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. The replacement string can include the following special replacement patterns: The arguments to the function are as follows: This logs 'Twas the night before Christmas...' This logs 'oranges are round, and oranges are juicy'. This logs 'Smith, John'. In this example, all occurrences of capital letters in the string are converted to lower case, and a hyphen is inserted just before the match location. The important thing here is that additional operations are needed on the matched item before it is given back as a replacement. The replacement function accepts the matched snippet as its parameter, and uses it to transform the case and concatenate the hyphen before returning. The following example replaces a Fahrenheit degree with its equivalent Celsius degree. The Fahrenheit degree should be a number ending with F. The function returns the Celsius number ending with C. For example, if the input number is 212F, the function returns 100C. If the number is 0F, the function returns -17.77777777777778C. The following example takes a string pattern and converts it into an array of objects. Input: Output: Snippet: Get the latest and greatest from MDN delivered straight to your inbox.
