Gregory told the British newspaper that she was introduced to Rodriguez through a friend and they began texting in December, when “he soon began pestering her to meet in person and begging her to bring friends for a threesome.” But they never actually met in person, and Page Six has not been able — nor willing — to independently identify what Gregory claims is a close-up shot of A-Rod’s erect, er, rod. However, pals of A-Rod’s are laughing off Gregory’s claims, saying nobody has any idea who the British model is and that Rodriguez has never met her. His rep didn’t comment. Charmingly, it turns out that Gregory has a porn alter ego, and appeared in 2018’s “Welcum to the Neighborhood.” The skin flick’s film company says about the movie on its site, “Hold on to your wallets because Robbin Banx doesn’t take cashier checks — she’s after cold hard cash!” A-Rod should perhaps take note, should they cross paths in the future.
