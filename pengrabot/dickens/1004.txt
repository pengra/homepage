After you have applied for admission, you will receive an email invitation to create a UW NetID. Follow the instructions in the email you receive. If you deleted your Coalition account after submitting your freshman application, you will not be able to create your UW NetID using the link above. Contact the Admissions Office to request your PAC and system key. You will need the email and password you used to submit your online application to create your UW NetID. If you forgot your online application email or password, use the links provided in the email you received to get help. Most applicants will not need a system key or PAC, however, some applicants will. To be sure, wait for the email with instructions for setting up your NetID. If you reset the password for the account you used to apply online, you can still create a UW NetID. Double check that you have the correct email and password by logging back into your online application account activity. Once you can log in successfully, proceed to create a UW NetID.
