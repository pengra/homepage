A planimeter computes the area of a region by tracing the boundary. Recall Green’s Theorem: Now let’s do some examples. So the this is the area of the trapezoid. Done. Green’s Theorem for the win! Finally, what do you do if you have a very strangely shaped curve? You approximate it with a polygonal curve. Check out next example. So the this is the area of the region. Green’s Theorem gives a fairly easy method for computing any the area of any polygonal region. Any region with a “smooth” border can be approximated by a polygonal region. The upshot? Green’s Theorem is a powerful tool for computing area. Now multiply entries of the columns diagonally down from the left to the right and add them together this is just saying that the line integral along the perimeter of the polygon is the sum of the line integrals along the edges.
