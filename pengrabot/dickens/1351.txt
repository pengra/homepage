An operating system (OS) is software that manages the interaction between hardware resources and the programs or applications you use on a computer. Most PCs have a version of the Windows operating system on them but Macintosh, Linux and UNIX are other popular operating systems. Besides learning the name of your operating system, such as whether you have Windows 7, you can find other useful information about your system. If you are worried about taxing your computer's central processing unit (CPU), for example, you may be able to check your operating system's bit version. A 64-bit version of Windows can process higher amounts of random access memory (RAM) better than a 32-bit version. Follow these methods to check a PC operating system.
