Q&A for work. A dedicated place to share your team’s knowledge. How can I convert a JavaScript string value to be in all lower case letters? Example: "Your Name" to "your name" …works exactly the same as toLowerCase   except that its result is intended to   yield the correct result for the host   environment’s current locale, rather   than a locale-independent result.   There will only be a difference in the   few cases (such as Turkish) where the   rules for that language conflict with   the regular Unicode case mappings. Example: and which is effectively equivalent to: So, you can do something like: toLocaleUpperCase() or lower case functions don't behave like they should do. For example in my system, Safari 4, Chrome 4 Beta, Firefox 3.5.x it converts strings with Turkish characters incorrectly. The browsers respond to navigator.language as "en-US", "tr", "en-US" respectively. But there is no way to get user's Accept-Lang setting in the browser as far as I could find. Only Chrome gives me trouble although I have configured every browser as tr-TR locale preferred. I think these settings only affect HTTP header, but we can't access to these settings via JS. For most languages, this will return the same as ...". I think it's valid for Turkish, it doesn't differ it's configured as en or tr. In Turkish it should convert "DİNÇ" to "dinç" and "DINÇ" to "dınç" or vice-versa. edited 2018 "SomE StriNg".toLowerCase() Here's the function that behaves exactly the same as PHP's one (for those who are porting PHP code into js) Note that the function will ONLY work on STRING objects. For instance, I was consuming a plugin, and was confused why I was getting a  "extension.tolowercase is not a function" JS error. Which produced the error "extension.toLowerCase is not a function" So I tried this piece of code, which revealed the problem! The output was"(typeof extension)=>object<=" - so AhHa, I was NOT getting a string var for my input.  The fix is straight forward though - just force the darn thing into a String!: After the cast, the extension.toLowerCase() function worked fine. Method or Function:     toLowerCase(),     toUpperCase() Description: These methods are used to cover a string or alphabet from lower case to upper case or vice versa. e.g: "and" to "AND". Converting to Upper Case:- Example Code:- Result: TESTING CASE CONVERSION METHOD Converting to Lower Case:-  Example Code: Result: testing lowercase convert function Explanation: In the above examples, Opt 1 : using toLowerCase(); Opt 2 : Using your own function Call it as: Try Demo - JSFiddle asked viewed active 3 months ago
