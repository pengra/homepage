This article gives a brief overview of what is corpus, types, applications and a short note on British National Corpus. What is Corpus? What is the use of Corpus? A corpus provides grammarians, lexicographers, and other interested parties with better discriptions of a language. Computer-procesable corpora allow linguists to adopt the principle of total accountability,  retrieving all the occurrences of a particular word or structure for inspection or randomly selcted samples. Corpus analysis provide lexical information, morphosyntactic information, semantic information and pragmatic information. Linguistic information is provided by concordance and frequency counts. What is Concordance? Concordances are listings of the occurrences of a particular feature or combination of fearures in a corpus. Each occurrence found (or hit) is displayed with a ceratain amount of context, the text preceding and following it. The most commonly used concordance type is KWIC whichs stands for Key Word In Context. It shows one hit per line of screen or print-out with principal search feature (or focus) highlighted in the centre. Concordance is used to determine the syntax in which a form is embedded. Concordances can be generated with Corpus Presenter and with Corpus Presenter Flash, programs allow one to retrieve the contexts in which a word occurs. Frequency Counts Frequency Counts the number of hits. Frequency counts require finding all the occurences of a particular feature in the corpus. So it is implicit in concordancing. Software is used for this purpose. Frequency counts can be explained statistically. British National Corpus Applications of Corpus Related Articles
