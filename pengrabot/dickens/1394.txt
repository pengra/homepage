To begin, a few nice quotes on Quantum Physics. From 1900 to 1930 there was a revolution in the foundations of our understanding          of light and matter interactions. In 1900 Planck showed that light energy          must be emitted and absorbed in discrete 'quanta' to explain blackbody          radiation. Then in 1905 Einstein showed that the energy of light is determined          by its frequency, where E=hf. Finally, in the late 1920s, de Broglie and          Schrodinger introduced the concept of Standing Waves to explain these          discrete frequency and energy states of light and matter (standing waves          only exist at discrete frequencies and thus energy states). So it is clear that Waves are central to Quantum Physics and our understanding          of the structure and discrete energy states of Matter (which explains          why Quantum Theory is also called Quantum Wave Mechanics). As we shall          explain, the problems and absurdities of quantum theory have been caused          by the continuing assumption of the discrete 'particle' concept for both          light and matter, and thus the resulting paradox of the 'Particle / Wave'          duality. For example, the obvious solution to the paradox of the particle / wave          duality of matter is to realise that the Wave-Center of the Spherical          Standing Wave causes the observed 'particle' effects of Matter (see wave          diagram below). Likewise, the discrete 'particle' properties of Light          (quanta / photons) are caused by Standing Wave interactions which only          occur at discrete frequencies and thus energy states. I think it is useful to end this quantum physics introduction with two          very important quotes. Firstly from Erwin Schrodinger; What we observe as material bodies and forces are nothing          but shapes and variations in the structure of space. Particles are just          schaumkommen (appearances). The world is given to me only once, not one          existing and one perceived. Subject and object are only one. The barrier          between them cannot be said to have broken down as a result of recent          experience in the physical sciences, for this barrier does not exist.          (Erwin Schrodinger, on Quantum Theory) Because Schrodinger believed in real waves, he was never happy with Max          Born's statistical / probability interpretation of the waves that became          commonly accepted (and was actively promoted by Heisenberg and Bohr) in          Quantum Theory / Mechanics. Let me say at the outset, that in this discourse, I am          opposing not a few special statements of quantum mechanics / quantum theory          held today (1950s), I am opposing as it were the whole of it, I am opposing          its basic views that have been shaped 25 years ago, when Max Born put          forward his probability interpretation, which was accepted by almost everybody.          (Schr√∂dinger E, The Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Ox Bow Press,          Woodbridge, CN, 1995) I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do          with it. (Erwin Schrodinger talking about quantum theory.) And I very strongly agree with Schrodinger (and greatly respect him)          when he writes; Secondly, David Bohm provides a clear account of how this incorrect 'particle'          conception of matter not only causes harm to the Sciences, but also to          the way we think and live, and thus to our very society and its future          evolution. So let us now explain and solve the many problems and paradoxes of Quantum          Theory using the Two Principles of the Metaphysics of Space and Motion          and the Spherical Wave Structure of Matter. During the years 1900-1930, many experiments were done on the interactions          of light beams, particle beams, and metal targets. Analysis of these experiments          showed that Light and Matter had both Particle and Wave properties. As          we have said, the solution to this apparent paradox of the Particle/Wave          duality is to simply explain how the discrete 'particle' properties (quanta)          are in fact caused by standing Wave interactions. Most importantly, Albert Einstein also suspected that Matter could not          be described by a continuous spherical force field; However, his work on the photoelectric effect confirmed that light energy          was only emitted and absorbed by electrons in discrete amounts or quanta.          This quanta of light energy soon became known as the 'photon' (i.e. discrete          like a particle) and led to the paradox that light behaved both as a continuous          e-m wave (Maxwell, Albert Einstein) as well as a discrete particle/photon          (Planck, Albert Einstein). So we see that Albert Einstein was partly responsible          for the discovery of the particle/photon concept of light, though he completely          rejected the notion of discrete particles. He writes; It is certainly true that the particle and its forces / fields are very          useful mathematical concepts, unfortunately, they also cause many problems          and paradoxes because they are approximations to reality and do not physically          exist. It is with some frustration that I now read these quotes, as it is obvious          in hindsight as to their errors, and how simply they can now be solved!          de Broglie's realisation that standing waves exist at discrete frequencies          and thus energies is obviously true and important, yet he continued with          the error of the particle concept and thus imagined particles moving in          a wavelike manner! Nonetheless, as he was close to the truth he had considerable          success with his theory, and these predicted wave properties of matter          were shortly thereafter confirmed from experiments (Davisson and Germer,          1927) on the scattering of electrons through crystals (which act as diffraction          slits). As Albert Einstein confirms; So by 1927 the wave properties of matter had been predicted theoretically          by de Broglie, and then confirmed by experiment. But unfortunately these          scientists continued to believe in the existence of discrete particles,          and thus they misinterpreted this most important discovery of the standing          wave properties of matter. In 1913, Niels Bohr had developed a simple (though only partly correct)          model for the hydrogen atom that assumed; (Our further comments in brackets) de Broglie assumed that because light had both particle and wave properties,          that this may also be true for matter. Thus he was not actually looking          for the wave structure of matter. Instead, as matter was already assumed          to be a particle, he was looking for wave properties of matter to complement          the known particle properties. As a consequence of this particle/wave          duality, de Broglie imagined the standing waves to be related to discrete          wavelengths and standing waves for certain orbits of the electron particle          about the proton. (Rather than considering the actual standing wave structure          of the electron itself.) From de Broglie's perspective, and from modern physics at that time,          this solution had a certain charm. It maintained the particle - wave duality          for BOTH light and matter, and at the same time explained why only certain          orbits of the electron (which relate to whole numbers of standing waves)          were allowed, which fitted beautifully with Niels Bohr model of the atom.          de Broglie further explains his reasoning for the particle/wave duality          of matter in his 1929 Nobel Prize acceptance speech; The solution to their problems was first found by Wolff (1986). He discovered          two things (both of which deserve a Nobel prize in their own right); Unfortunately for modern physics, and ultimately for human knowledge,          this obvious solution was never considered by de Broglie, Albert Einstein,          Bohr, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Dirac, Born, Feynman, etc. etc. Thus the          now obvious solution of realising that matter was a Spherical Standing          Wave that causes the point particle effect at the Wave-Center remained          unknown and ignored, and instead, the confusing and paradoxical concept          of the particle / wave duality was retained. As stated, in hindsight there were many clues as to the Wave Structure          of the Electron. Another obvious clue being that the electron itself has          a 'Compton' wavelength (named after American experimental physicist Holly          Compton who discovered this from experiments with electron beams). But          unfortunately they had come to accept the particle / wave duality of matter          and simply continued to assume that somehow this paradoxical conception          of matter was true, and thus beyond human comprehension. (So they stopped          looking for an obvious solution!) Quantum theory was thus essentially founded on the experimental observations          of frequency and wavelength for both light and matter. These empirical          facts are obviously consistent with the Spherical Standing Wave structure          of matter. From this it was further found that only certain frequency wave functions,          like frequencies on musical strings, were allowed to exist. These allowed          functions and their frequencies depended on the confining structure (atom          or molecule) that the electron was bound to (analogous to how strings          are bound to a violin, and only then can they resonate at certain frequencies). Significantly, these allowed frequencies corresponded to the observed          discrete frequencies of light emitted and absorbed by electrons bound          in atoms/molecules. This further confirmed the standing wave properties          of matter, and thus that only certain standing wave frequencies could          exist which corresponded to certain energy states. The agreement of observed          frequencies and Schrodinger's Wave Equations further established the fundamental          importance of Quantum Theory and thus the Wave properties of both light          and matter. As Albert Einstein explains; Spherical Wave Motions of Space are Scalar waves - at each point in Space          the wave equations yield a single quantity which simply describes the          wave amplitude (there is no directional component). For example, sound          waves are scalar waves where the wave amplitude describes the Motion (or          compression) of the wave medium (air). Likewise Space is a nearly rigid          Wave-Medium which propagates Wave-Motions. So let us now explain in more detail this phenomena of Light energy being          emitted and absorbed in discrete amounts (photons) due to Resonant Standing          Wave interactions. Firstly, we must understand Principle Two and realise          that the velocity of wave Motions in Space is not constant, and in fact          depends upon both the Wave-Amplitude and the mass-energy density of space (square of Wave-Amplitude).          These are simply the properties of Space as a Wave-medium. It is the nature of Principles that they are stated rather than deduced.          Thus we must state the Properties of Space, as Principles, and then demonstrate          that logical deductions from these Principles do in fact correspond to          observation. What we have found is that if Space behaves in the following          way, then it gives rise to deductions which correspond to observation          and experiment. Thus when we place two electrons near one another in Space, then the          Wave-Amplitude of Space between them increases because the Waves are in          phase and the Wave-Amplitudes combine and increase, thus the Wave-Velocity          increases (opposite to gravity's slowing of In-Waves) and this causes          the Wave-Centers to move apart. This explains the electrical repulsion          of like charges. What we must further realise is that Light is only emitted and absorbed          by electrons bound in atoms or molecules, and these electrons have some          complex repeating Standing Wave-Motion about the nucleus. Thus the electrons          behave as 'oscillating resonators' and it is common knowledge to electrical          engineers and physicists that two interconnected resonators can undergo          resonant coupling, where one resonator decreases in frequency and the          other one increases a corresponding amount. Thus two bound resonating electrons (oscillators) exchange energy much          like classical coupled oscillators, such as electric circuits or joined          pendulums. The coupling provided by the non-linear centers of the resonances          (high Wave-Amplitude Wave-Centers where the Wave-Velocities change ) causes          them to change velocity, frequency, and wavelength, due to the interaction          (modulation) of each other's waves. Since significant coupling can only          occur between two oscillators which possess the same resonant elements,          the frequency (energy) changes are equal and opposite. This we observe          as the law of conservation of energy. Thus we realise that these different standing Wave patterns cause a cyclical          oscillation in the Shape of the In and Out-Waves which describes a wave          function that is ultimately the cause of the 'electromagnetic' wavelength          and frequency of light. As only certain discrete 'orbits' (standing wave          functions) exist for the Wave-Center of the Spherical Standing Wave, then          it can only exchange frequencies in discrete levels which correspond to          discrete energy exchanges of light 'photons'. i.e. E=hf where only discrete          frequencies (f) area resonantly stable and thus 'allowed'. (There are          no separate light 'particles / photons' or collapsing wave functions,          both being mathematical existents only!) Most importantly, these standing wave interactions and resonant coupling          are the reason for Schrodinger's Standing Wave Equations and their obvious          success at explaining the allowed energy states for electrons in atoms,          and thus the discrete photon effect of light as these electrons move from          one resonant standing wave pattern (quantum state) to another. On Chance and Probability in a Necessarily Interconnected          finite spherical Universe within a Non-Determined Infinite Space At the same time that the wave properties of matter were discovered,          two further discoveries were made that also profoundly influenced (and          confused) the future evolution of modern physics. Nonetheless, Albert Einstein was very close to the truth. He realised          that because matter is spherically spatially extended we must give up          the idea of complete localization and knowledge of the 'particle' in a          theoretical model. For the particle is nothing but the Wave-Center of          a Spherical Standing Wave, and thus can never be isolated as an entity          in itself, but is dependent on its interactions with all the other Matter          in the Universe. And it is this lack of knowledge of the system as a whole          that is the ultimate cause of the uncertainty and resultant probability          inherent in Quantum Theory. Albert Einstein believed that Reality could be represented by spherical          force fields, that reality was not founded on chance (as Bohr and Heisenberg          argued) but on necessary connections between things (thus his comment          'God does not play dice'!). He was largely correct, Matter is necessarily          connected due to the Spherical Standing Wave Structure of Matter, but          due to lack of knowledge of the system as a whole (the Universe), and          the fact that it is impossible to determine an Infinite system (of which          our finite spherical universe is a part - see Article on Cosmology), then          this gives rise to the chance and uncertainty found in Quantum Theory. QED is founded on the assumption that charged 'particles' somehow generate          spherical electromagnetic (vector) In and Out Waves (a dynamic version          of Lorentz's Theory of the Electron, as Feynman uses spherical electromagnetic          Waves, rather than static force fields). It is important to realise though,          that like most post-modern physicists, Richard Feynman was a Logical Positivist.          Thus he did not believe in the existence of either particles or waves,          he simply used this conceptual language as a way of representing how matter          behaves in a logical way. As he says; This explains why he had such success and such failure at the same time,          as he had the correct spherical wave structure of Matter, but he continued          with two further errors, the existence of the particle, and the use of          vector 'electromagnetic' waves (mathematical waves of force), rather than          using the correct scalar 'quantum' waves. It is this error of Feynman's          that ultimately led Wolff to make his remarkable discoveries of the WSM. The problem for QED is twofold; Firstly, there is the Problem of 'Renormalisation' - Feynman must assume          finite dimensions for the particle, else the spherical electromagnetic          waves would reach infinite fields strengths when the radius of the spherical          electromagnetic waves tends to zero. There must be some non-zero cut-off          that is arbitrarily introduced by having a 'particle' of a certain finite          size. Effectively, Feynman gets infinities in his equations, and then          he subtract infinity from infinity and puts in the correct empirical answer          (which is not good mathematics, but it does then work extraordinarily          well!) In fact Nature behaves in a very sensible and logical way (which explains          why mathematical physics exists as a subject and can describe so many          phenomena, and also explains how we 'humans' have been able to evolve          a logical aspect to our minds!). That it is not Nature which is strange,          but our incorrect conceptions of Nature! Most importantly, the simple          sensible solutions to these problems can be easily understood once we          know the correct Wave Structure of Matter. Richard Feynman was obviously also aware of this problem, and had this          to say about renormalisation. Albert Einstein was also aware of this problem as he explains in his          critique of Lorentz's electromagnetic field theory for electrons (as it          is still the same fundamental problem of the particle / electromagnetic          field duality). Feynman's Spherical IN OUT wave theory is largely correct (and of course          explains his success) but his error of using vector e-m waves resulted          in infinities at the point particle as the radius tended to zero, and          this led to the errors of renormalisation. In reality, Matter, as a structure          of scalar spherical quantum waves, has a finite wave amplitude at the          Wave-Center (as observed) and thus eliminates the infinities and the problems          of renormalisation found in Feynman's Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). James Maxwell (1876) used the experimental (empirical) results of Faraday,          Coulomb, etc. to develop four equations, now famous, whose solutions described          an electromagnetic (e-m) wave which correctly deduced the velocity of          light c. Maxwell was correct that light is a wave traveling with velocity          c - but it is a wave developed from the interaction of the IN and OUT          waves of two spherical standing waves whose Wave-Centers are bound in          resonant standing wave patterns. (Thus it is the interaction of four waves          which probably explains why there are four Maxwell Equations.) The Maxwell's Equations (M.E.), which describe the formation of electric          fields E by a charge distribution q and changing magnetic fields H, as          well as the formation of the H field by a changing E and electric currents          i, cannot describe a spherical electromagnetic wave! It is a mathematical          fact that there are no wave solutions of the M.E.s in spherical co-ordinates!          Only the scalar 'quantum' wave equation has spherical wave solutions.          Similarly, there are no imaginable M.E. solutions for a 'photon particle'.          It is clear that the M.E.s are not fundamental and the photon is only          a mathematical construction. The failure of the M.E. in spherical co-ordinates can be imagined by          saying, You cannot comb the hair on a tennis ball. This means that if          you attempt to comb down an E field (the hair representing the electric          vector) everywhere flat onto a tennis ball (a spherical surface), you          must create a 'cowlick' somewhere on the ball which frustrates your attempt          to comb it. Once we understand though, that the particle theory of matter is a mathematical          (logical positivist) description of nature, then it becomes less confusing.          Essentially the particle is a mathematical construction to describe energy          exchange. It says nothing about the energy exchange mechanism and thus          makes no comment about how the particle exists, how it moves through Space,          what the Space around the particle is made of, and how matter particles          'emit' and 'absorb' photon particles with other matter particles distant          in Space. Let us then consider one fundamentally important argument of Feynman's          that light must be a particle. It is also interesting to see how simply Feynman summarizes QED; Once we realise that there are no separate electron or photon particles,          thus we remove the problem as to how an electron particle can interact          with a separate photon particle! Thus this solution is actually more consistent          (and simpler) than Feynman's QED, particularly when we consider Feynman's          further explanation of a positron being an electron which goes backwards          in Time. 'The Ultimate Paradox - Bell's Theorem' by Milo Wolff,          Exploring the Physics of the Unknown Universe, 1994 His theorem relates to the results of an experiment like the one shown          in Figure 1.7.1 (see above): A source of two paired photons, obtained          from the simultaneous decay of two excited atomic states, is at the center.          At opposite sides, are located two detectors of polarized photons. The          polarization filters of each detector can be set parallel to each other,          or at some other angle, freely chosen. It is known that polarizations          of paired photons are always parallel to each other, but random with respect          to their surroundings. So, if the detector filters are set parallel, both          photons will be detected simultaneously. If the filters are at right angles,          the two photons will never be detected together. The detection pattern          for settings at intermediate angles is the subject of the theorem. The Wave Structure of Matter is a profound new way of looking at how          Matter exists and interacts with other matter in Space. Wolff has explained          a very simple change to a very famous experiment that currently causes          Quantum Theory, and Human intellectual knowledge in general, profound          problems and paradoxes. Thus it seems to us absolutely essential that          this experiment be re-done as suggested above. We sincerely hope that          this work on the Metaphysics of Space and Motion and the Spherical Wave          Structure of Matter will ultimately lead to this new 'Paradigm' being          taken seriously, and that this experiment will be performed sooner rather          than later!
