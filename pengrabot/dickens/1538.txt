Sucuri Blog Website Security News Vulnerability researchers are the good guys – people who won’t take advantage of the vulnerability for their own gain and who will exercise responsible disclosure. Let’s illustrate this concept with a small example. In this example, I don’t have code audits by other developers, which is really bad, and this vulnerability was not picked up by neither my manual or automatic tests. To complement this bad scenario, not a single user of my plugin cared enough to audit the new code either. So this vulnerability is just sitting there, unnoticed. If an attacker learns about this vulnerability, it won’t change anything since the attacker won’t be interested in the patching of it; however, they will be interested in exploiting it. As in our last example, when the bad actors learn about a security vulnerability before the project’s maintainers, users, and vulnerability researchers do, things can get ugly really fast.
