Home Clash will be the name of the new mode and it is already being beta tested. The mode will run in short sessions that will be a few days long, being held throughout the year on different occasions. If players want to access the competitive mode, they can do so my buying participation tickets. You can buy them in Blue Essence, RP or any in game mission, after which Riot will be able to make more rewards available. No matter what rank they are, any team can be eligible for entry, so competitive play will be opened up to thousands more who want to play. It is the hope of Riot that this will turn into an ultimate competition that can be played across any esports game title. Clash will have many great new features that will definitely be a hit with all League of Legends players. Teams will even be able to scout for their own opponents, to help with bans and picks for specific games. There will also be a format, much like that of the esports professionals, for picking champs. Riot has made quick efforts to make sure that there are no fears that Clash will be manipulated by “smurfs”. These experienced players create brand new accounts and pretend to be new players. This gives opposition that is not only unfair, but overly competitive because of their lying. The developer says plans are currently in place, with more coming up shortly, and they will let players know when this mode makes its official launch, sometime in the near future. Already, it is probably one of the most highly anticipated released to come out this year. The 2017 League of Legends World Championship was concluded on November 4, 2017. Samsung Galaxy was crowned winner after beating the SK Telecom T1 in the last round.
