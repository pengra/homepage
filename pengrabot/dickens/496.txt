CIM’s robust Music Theory program provides students with the aural and analytical skills that aid in the development of the perceptive and thinking musician. At CIM, virtually all conservatory students study with members of the Music Theory faculty. Theory instruction is provided for every degree program, from basic musicianship and remedial courses to upper-level specialized seminars. CIM’s Music Theory faculty constitutes a diverse and distinguished collective of musician-scholars. Their varied backgrounds include training as composers, vocalists, pianists, string players and brass players. Incoming students are placed into one of CIM's music theory courses—MUTH 101 (Music Theory & Aural Skills I) or MUTH 101i (Intensive Music Theory & Aural Skills)—based on diagnostic test results. Learn more about each course and what to expect, and find additional resources. Before students enroll in graduate music theory courses, they first must demonstrate proficiency in harmony, form, counterpoint, sight-singing and aural training, as determined by the CIM diagnostic test. Find out what will be on the diagnostic test and what to expect from the placement courses. The Cleveland Institute of Music, a legendary powerhouse of classical music training since its beginnings nearly a century ago, continues to impress chamber music judges across the country and around the world. CIM has received a $1 million donation from Board of Trustees Chairman Richard J. Hipple and his wife, Jean, to establish CIM’s first Dean’s Scholarship, which will provide full tuition to an outstanding student.
