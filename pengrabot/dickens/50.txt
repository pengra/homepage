This course treats several topics in hardware security: The main focus is secure processor architectures – we will discuss Intel SGX as well as academic processors such as Aegis, Ascend, and Sanctum and we will discuss cryptographic concepts (no proofs or formal definitions) such as AES, RSA, Hash, MAC, digital signatures, public key encryption, ORAM. During the second half of the course we explain side channel attacks, physical unclonable functions, TRNG, supply chain management, and hardware Trojans in more detail and we give an overview of several other topics (in particular, we will talk about the power grid and smart cities). Several coding labs will give sufficient understanding of the most important taught subjects. Since this course is completely new, ECE 3401 is no longer a prerequisite. Students need to make an appointment with the instructor to obtain a permission number. During each meeting the instructor verifies whether the student understands the workload and whether the student has some basic understanding of computer architecture and/or crypto – even though the course is self-contained some prior understanding will make the workload less. Students are required to have some level of independence in taking responsibility for their own success.
