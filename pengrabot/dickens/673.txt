Now, this is not particularly useful because we have so few cases, but it’s useful to have a small example to explain the syntax: You should see the value of a switch statement in a larger example: For example, imagine a computer for a traffic light. You might have three different states: red, yellow, or green. You could also have an “advance” input that progresses the traffic light. We can represent this stateful system in a FSM, and it turns out most of the time the standard is to just draw it: Where each circle is a state – green, yellow, or red – and the arrows indicate how the one input changes the systems state. The disconnected arrow indicates the initial state. You can also have multiple outputs for each state. Consider the long-studied and intractible problem of getting a hot pocket fully cooked:
