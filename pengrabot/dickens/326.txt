Boeing makes a lot of money selling planes around the world. But if you want all the bells and whistles that help ensure those planes don’t fall out of the sky, that sometimes costs extra. At least that’s the conclusion that some experts are coming to as investigations continue into what caused two plane crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in the past five months. Both flights were the new Boeing 737 Max-8 model planes and both aircraft lacked safety features that are sold as “extras” by Boeing, like a special light that notifies pilots when software on the plane may be getting a false reading. “They’re critical, and cost almost nothing for the airlines to install,” Bjorn Fehrm, an analyst with the aviation firm Leeham, told the Times. “Boeing charges for them because it can. But they’re vital for safety.” As the Times notes, the two safety features at issue are the “angle of attack” sensor and a “disagree” light.

The system, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), may have gotten a false reading in both crashes, but without the optional “disagree” light to indicate that different sensors may be picking up different readings, the pilots might not have known what was going on.

A guardrail wasn’t in place. Once the aircraft was airborne, the erroneous Angle of Attack data collided with an apparently unprepared crew with tragic consequences as the MCAS system repeatedly activated, driving the jet’s nose into a fatal dive.
