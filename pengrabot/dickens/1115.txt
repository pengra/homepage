Hey, look at that. A cryptocurrency exchange has decided to do the right thing â€“ albeit belatedly, and only after a sustained public outcry. Today, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong copped to making a pretty big mistake. It is not clear at this time exactly what "transition out of Coinbase" means. Will the former Hacking Team employees get to stay on for an additional few months? Will they receive a severance package? We reached out to Coinbase in an attempt to answer those questions, but have not received a response as of press time. How the company handles the departure of these employees will go a long way toward demonstrating what its "values" truly are. Either way, it seems like Coinbase decided it didn't need this headache on its hands.
