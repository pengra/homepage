I kinda want to switch from evilmode to emacs binding but honestly I'm scared I'm going to take a huge performance hit. I've been a bit user for a long time and using spacemacs for about a year now. I love evil (and spacesmacs)  but it's hard in stuff like org and other esoteric modes that were built around emacs bindings. Like how do you do cw or dd or dt or surround a visual block with say quotes? Anyone interested in showing off their configs this month? Hello all, I'm a software engineer, and I've recently started using org-agenda quite extensively along with org-mode to maintain and track my projects and time at work. I'm loving it so far. Is anyone else successfully using excorporate with org-mode 9.2? Here's my configuration (edited for corporate privacy) Let's imagine that I have this kind of text in a buffer: It may look like there is only two cursors left, but it's not. I still have 3 multiple cursors, and two of them are positioned one on top of another. In Kakoune there will be only 2 cursors, because cursors are merged into single one if their positions are the same. Which makes no sense to me. I want cursors to be merged if their position is the same, is that possible? 27.4k Subscribers 113 Online The extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor.
