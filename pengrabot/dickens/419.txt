This is a naive approach that fails in the following cases: Deleted/banned accounts: Deleted/banned account usernames tend to be unavailable even though the profile pages might not exist Therefore, these tools tend to come up with false positives and negatives. This method of checking also cannot be extended to email addresses or platforms which don't use traditional profile pages. socialscan aims to plug these gaps. socialscan can also be imported into existing code and used as a library. Executing single queries: Executing multiple queries concurrently requires a bit more setup: MIT
