The visualization couldn’t load because JavaScript is disabled. There are over a dozen different example machines to explore. The current state and tape cell are highlighted. That’s it! Each machine has a finite number of states, and a finite number of possible symbols.                 These are fixed before the machine starts, and do not change as the machine runs. (As a mathematical model, a Turing machine has infinite memory (an infinite tape) so as to not artificially restrict its power.                 In practice, many machines of interest take finite memory, and can be fully simulated for manageable input sizes.                 Even machines that use infinite memory—and hence never halt—use at most one new tape cell per step, and so can be simulated to an extent.) The formal definition of a Turing machine has slight variations but essentially is a tuple (ordered list) comprising where Q, Σ, and Γ are finite nonempty sets.                 Some definitions also require that the blank symbol not be part of the input (b ∉ Σ). As an example, a formal description for the “binary increment” machine is as follows: Note that for simplicity, the simulator limits each symbol to one character.                 Furthermore, input is not checked for conformance with an input alphabet, in exchange for not having to define input and tape alphabets. Some aspects of the definition vary from author to author, but the differences come down to preference and do not affect computational power.                 That is, machines on one model can be simulated or converted to run on another model. Some of the variations you may come across: The simulator was designed with these and other considerations in mind. All it takes to describe a Turing machine is a start state, blank symbol, and transition table. For brevity, you can omit the symbol and state if they stay the same. The code editor and keyboard shortcuts require that JavaScript be enabled. Some strings need to be quoted: for example, those that start/end with a space, or include certain characters that have special meaning in YAML.           If a string is causing problems, try putting quotes around it.
