Find out what's new with Heroku on our blog. PostgreSQL is one of the world's most popular relational database           management systems. Millions of developers and companies rely on           PostgreSQL as their transactional data store of choice to drive           application health and decision-making. And developers with knowledge           of Oracle or MySQL databases can use their SQL querying experience           to quickly leverage PostgreSQL's capabilities as a fast, functional,           and powerful data resource. We've taken Heroku's operational expertise of scaling applications,               and integrated useful runtime features for developers worldwide,               and we've applied it to the data stack. Heroku's integration of               managed data services alongside our application runtime provides               a seamless approach to building applications with a solid data               layer built in - all while having complete control of how you want               to build your applications on the Heroku platform. We've been running one of the world's largest fleets of Postgres databases               for years, providing us with a deep understanding of how to make it better               for our customers. Whether it's an index that’s not being used,               security patches that have to be applied, or guidance relevant to ensuring               your database is performing well, we’re here to guide you along the way. Heroku Postgres helps you maximize your data instead of spending time               on database setup and maintenance. Test new schema migrations, manage               database access levels and protect queries, scale horizontally, and               allow your team to quickly access data. Whether it's features like               Continuous Protection or seamlessly applying the latest security patch,               you can rest easy as your database is being protected by our               behind-the-scenes efforts. heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev Creating heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev on ⬢ sushi... free Database has been created and is available Heroku Postgres databases are constantly monitored to ensure the health of your database. Should any health check fail automated processes are kicked off to restore your database to ideal working order. Where application uptime is critical the Heroku Postgres Premium tier and above offers higher availability through automatic failover. We take care of uptime so you can focus on growing your application. Postgres 11 on Heroku allows us to manage some of our most complex data use cases at scale, including partitioning large tables and parallelizing advanced queries. This allowed our developers to stay focused on working with the data instead of building the infrastructure to support it. Upgrading to Postgres 11 was seamless on Heroku. And whenever the word ‘seamless’ is involved in promoting library, language, or database versions, I'm loving life. By introducing safe and performant schema migrations of non-nullable columns in a single step, Postgres 11 has made the already excellent developer experience of Heroku Postgres even better. As our business has rapidly grown, Heroku Postgres has scaled with us. Our Heroku Postgres database is performant, secure, and reliable, and we sleep better at night knowing that Heroku's team is monitoring it for us 24/7. It's allowed us to quickly create a sophisticated development pipeline that would have been difficult otherwise. It's hard to imagine trying to build our business on any other infrastructure.
