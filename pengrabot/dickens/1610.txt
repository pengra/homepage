Q&A for work. A dedicated place to share your teamâ€™s knowledge. This question already has an answer here: I'm trying to order a query set by a property I defined in the model, but not sure the best way to do this. Here's the property: Essentially, I'd like to do a: but of course getting a Caught FieldError while rendering: Cannot resolve keyword 'name' into field. Any ideas? You can't do that because that property is not in MySQL, but in your python code. If you really want to do this, you can on the client-side(though it will be very slow): You can only order by database fields. You can pull all records, turn them into a list, and sort them, although that may be inefficient and slow. asked viewed active 7 years, 3 months ago
