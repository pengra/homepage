Instead of just bitching and moaning on the Internet I decided to reach out to one of the founders of unsplash, Mikael Cho. Mikael graciously agreed to talk and we spent nearly an hour discussing the platform and what it means to the photography industry as a whole. I will be uploading my final thoughts about all of this in a few days. Below is the email I sent to Mikael, and some links to posts I mentioned during the interview. If you have thoughts on all of this, hit me up in the comments below! Hi Mikael, A full time commercial and editorial photographer, Zack shoots everything from bands to CEOs to ad campaigns. A gifted teacher and communicator, he has an uncanny ability to meet and connect with all types of people.
