 These contributions include: Data structures and algorithms are the study of commonly used computational methods and their computational efficiency. This branch of computer science aims to manage networks between computers worldwide. Research that develops theories, principles, and guidelines for user interface designers, so they can create satisfactory user experiences with desktop, laptop, and mobile devices. Software engineering is the study of designing, implementing, and modifying software in order to ensure it is of high quality, affordable, maintainable, and fast to build. It is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to software. Software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of softwareâ€”it doesn't just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software, but its internal maintenance and arrangement. Programming languages can be used to accomplish different tasks in different ways. Common programming paradigms include:
