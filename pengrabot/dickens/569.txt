ReactJS is JavaScript library used for building reusable UI components. According to React official documentation, following is the definition − React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components, which present data that changes over time. Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. React abstracts away the DOM from you, offering a simpler programming model and better performance. React can also render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps using React Native. React implements one-way reactive data flow, which reduces the boilerplate and is easier to reason about than traditional data binding. Uses virtual DOM which is a JavaScript object. This will improve apps performance, since JavaScript virtual DOM is faster than the regular DOM. Can be used on client and server side as well as with other frameworks. Component and data patterns improve readability, which helps to maintain larger apps. Covers only the view layer of the app, hence you still need to choose other technologies to get a complete tooling set for development. Uses inline templating and JSX, which might seem awkward to some developers. © Copyright 2019. All Rights Reserved.
