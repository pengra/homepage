Since the late 1990s, before spam became the problem it is at the 	moment, we have offered @xemacs.org addresses to participants in the 	project. Following the infrastructure problems of 2016, these 	haven't in general been restoredâ€”most of them function more as 	spam traps rather than legitimate email addresses. The web and FTP sites are now (late December 2016) back up, and we         should have our lists and mail addresses available again soon. is.xemacs.org is taking some time off, but will return before long. FTP mirrors ftp.pl.xemacs.org and sunsite.sut.ac.jp have not been functional for a while and have now been removed. XEmacs Website Mirrors exist on following continents.  Pick the     continent where your internet service provider resides, which is     not always the continent you may sit on.  This is most likely to     matter when you work for an international company with no local     internet connection.
