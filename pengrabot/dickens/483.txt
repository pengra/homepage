What Is Music Theory?

Being able to transcribe music makes it possible for other musicians to read and play compositions exactly as the composer intended. Learning to read music is almost exactly like learning a new language, to the point where a fluent person can “hear” a musical “conversation” when reading a piece of sheet music. There are plenty of intuitive, self-taught musicians out there who have never learned to read or write music and find the whole idea of learning music theory tedious and unnecessary. However, just like the educational leaps that can come with learning to read and write, music theory can help musicians learn new techniques, perform unfamiliar styles of music, and develop the confidence to try new things. However, the inescapable fact is this: you get out of music what you put into it. If you want to be able to play classical music, you must be able to keep a steady beat, and understanding how the harmonies fit together can make it much easier to play because you can see what’s coming before you even get there. If you want to be a rock musician, then knowing the notes you need to play in a given key is especially important. Learning to play and understand music takes a lot of personal discipline, but in the end, it’s worth all the hard work.
