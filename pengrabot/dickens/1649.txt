Notice that the spaces at the beginning of the string are removed. We can enhance this function by specifying a list of characters to remove. The enhanced version is shown below. The following examples show how you can delete a given set of characters from the beginning of the string. The first example trims the lowercase characters “o”, “e”, and “l”, and the uppercase “H”. The second example trims the lowercase “h”. Since the string begins with a capital “H”, no trimming occurs. A trim function is useful for removing extra spaces typed by users. Often times, users aren’t even aware that they typed extra spaces. This fact could also lead to login problems if, for example, a user registered himself with a trailing whitespace. However, this is not the only use case for trimming. Using the enhanced versions of the trim functions presented in this article, you’ll also be able to solve a wider range of problems than the native ones can solve. © 2000 – 2019 SitePoint Pty. Ltd.
