Glad to see that the Open Dylan project has released binaries recently.  If you don't mind, a few questions... Does the the warning below mean that the 32 bit version of the Open Dylan IDE DOES work on 64 bit Windows 8 and later versions of 64 bit Windows? Is there a 64 bit version of Open Dylan and the Open Dylan IDE for Windows as a binary release? Is there a 64 bit version of Open Dylan and the Open Dylan IDE for Windows as a source code release? Warning The 32 bit version of Open Dylan IDE does NOT work on 64 bit Windows prior to Windows 8. There is no workaround at this time, unfortunately. We hope to resolve this in an upcoming release. However, the command line tools should work as the problem is with interaction between threads, GC and WoW64. Wow, I haven't seen anything about Dylan since Creatures 3 was new... 90 Subscribers 4 Online News about Open Dylan and other things in the Dylan programming community.
