Please don't use switches that make debugging hard or impossible when you build pretest or snapshot binaries.  The main purpose of these binaries is to report bugs in Emacs, which is hardly possible when debugging symbols were stripped from the binary, and you used switches such as -fomit-frame-pointer that make C-level backtraces hard or impossible to read.  I presume you just use the scripts provided by MSYS2, in which case please convey the above to the MSYS2 people who proliferate these scripts indiscriminately, thereby making the life of the upstream package maintainers harder.  Thanks in advance, and keep up the good work! Nice  project. Thanks Very reliable build of the original GNU Emacs on Windows with nothing more or less. Very good! Can't live without emacs and a 64-bit native Windows version fits my needs perfectly. Thanks so much!
