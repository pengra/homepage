Y Combinator created a new model for funding early stage startups. Twice a year we invest a small amount of money ($150k) in a large number of startups (recently 200).  The startups move to Silicon Valley for 3 months, during which we work intensively with them to get the company into the best possible shape and refine their pitch to investors. Each cycle culminates in Demo Day, when the startups present their companies to a carefully selected, invite-only audience.  But YC doesn’t end on Demo Day. We and the YC alumni network continue to help founders for the life of their company, and beyond. We’re excited to announce that we’ll be holding interviews for the Summer 2019 batch in Bangalore for founders based in India. This will take place from May 7 to 9. Amy Buechler is an executive coach for startup founders. Michael Seibel is a partner and the CEO of YC. In this episode we talk about coaching and use examples from Michael’s time working on Justin.tv and Socialcam. Marques Brownlee is a YouTuber. He has over 8 million subscribers to his channel MKBHD where he reviews electronics, drives electric vehicles, and interviews people such as Kobe Bryant and Bill Gates. We are about to kick off the second day of YC’s 28th Demo Day. In total, 189 companies will present over two days. Below are stats about the W19 batch.
