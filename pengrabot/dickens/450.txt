Let \(C\) be a positively oriented, piecewise smooth, simple closed curve in a plane, and let \(D\) be the region bounded by \(C\). If \(P\) and \(Q\) are functions of \((x, y)\) defined on an open region containing \(D\) and have continuous partial derivatives there, then \[ \oint_C (P \, dx + Q \, dy) = \iint_D \left( \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \right) dx \, dy, \] where the path integral is traversed counterclockwise. Evaluate the integral \[ \oint_C \big(y^2 \, dx + x^2 \, dy\big), \] where \(C\) is the boundary of the upper half of the unit disk, traversed counterclockwise. Let \(C\) be the region enclosed by the \(x\)-axis and the two circles \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\) and \(x^2+y^2 = 4\) (as shown by the red curves in the figure). What is the value of \[ \displaystyle \oint_C (y^2\, dx + 5xy\, dy) ? \] Let \(G\) be a continuous function of two variables with continuous partial derivatives, and let \({\bf F} = \nabla G\) be the gradient of \(G,\) defined by \({\bf F} = \left( \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial x}, \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial y} \right).\) Show that \[ \oint_C {\bf F} \cdot (dx,dy) = \oint_C \left( \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial x} \, dx + \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial y} \, dy \right) = 0 \] for any closed curve \(C.\) Evaluate the following line integral:  \[ \oint_C \left[ \big(4x^2 + 3x + 5y\big)\, dx + \big(6x^2 + 5x + 3y\big)\, dy \right],\] where \(C\) is the path around the square with vertices \((0,0), (2,0), (2,2)\) and \((0,2)\). Green's theorem can be used "in reverse" to compute certain double integrals as well. It is necessary that the integrand be expressible in the form given on the right side of Green's theorem. Here is a very useful example. Let \(R\) be a plane region enclosed by a simple closed curve \(C.\) Show that the area of \(R\) equals any of the following integrals (where the path is traversed counterclockwise): \[ \oint_C x \, dy, \quad -\oint_C y \, dx, \quad \frac12 \oint_C (x \, dy - y \, dx). \] As an application, compute the area of an ellipse with semi-major axes \(a\) and \(b.\) The proof of the first statement is immediate: Green's theorem applied to any of the three integrals above shows that they all equal \[ \iint_R 1 \, dx \, dy, \] which is the area of \(R.\) This method is especially useful for regions bounded by parametric curves. Consider the curve defined by the parametric equations  \[\begin{cases} x=a\sin \theta \\ y = a\sin^2 \theta \cos \theta \end{cases} \] for \(0 \le \theta \le 2\pi.\) What is the area enclosed by the curve? The proof reduces the problem to Green's theorem. Write \(f = u+iv\) and \(dz = dx + i dy.\) Then the integral is \[ \oint_C (u+iv)(dx+i dy) = \oint_C (u \, dx - v \, dy) + i \oint_C (v \, dx + u \, dy). \] These integrals can be evaluated by Green's theorem: \[ \begin{align} \oint_C (u \, dx - v \, dy) &= \iint_R \left(- \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right) dx \, dy \\ \oint_C (v \, dx + u \, dy) &= \iint_R \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \right) dx \, dy. \end{align} \] \[\oint_C \mathbf F\cdot d\mathbf s =\oint_C P \, d\hat{\mathbf x}+Q \, d\hat{\mathbf y}  =\iint_R \left(\dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\dfrac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) \, dx \, dy.\] Let us say that the curve \(C\) is made up of two curves \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) such that \[\begin{align} C_1: y &= f_1(x) \ \forall a\leq x\leq b\\ C_2: y &= f_2(x) \ \forall b\leq x\leq a. \end{align}\] Now, under the following conditions, integrating \(\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\) with respect to \(y\) between \(y=f_1(x)\) and \(y=f_2(x)\) yields \[\int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)}\dfrac{\partial P}{\partial y} \, dy = P(x,f_2(x))-P(x,f_1(x)).\] Integrating the resulting integrand over the interval \((a,b)\), we obtain \[\begin{align} \int_a^b\int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)}\dfrac{\partial P}{\partial y} \, dy \, dx &=\int_a^b \big(P(x,f_2(x))-P(x,f_1(x))\big) \, dx\\ &=\int_a^b (P(x,f_2(x)) \, dx -\int_a^b (P(x,f_1(x)) \, dx\\ &=-\int_b^a (P(x,f_2(x)) \, dx -\int_a^b (P(x,f_1(x)) \, dx\\ &=-\int_{C_2} P \, dx-\int_{C_1} P \, dx \\ &=-\oint_{C} P \, dx.\\ \end{align}\] Thus, we arrive at the first half of the required expression \[\oint_{C} P \, dx = -\int_a^b\int_{f_1(x)}^{f_2(x)}\dfrac{\partial P}{\partial y} \, dy \, dx=\iint_R \left(-\dfrac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) \, dx \, dy.\] Similarly, we can arrive at the other half of the proof. Let us say the curve \(C\) is made up of two curves \(C'_1\) and \(C'_2\) such that \[\begin{align} C'_1: x &= g_1(y) \ \forall d\leq x\leq c\\ C'_2: x &= g_2(y) \ \forall c\leq x\leq d. \end{align}\] Now, integrating \(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}\) with respect to \(x\) between \(x=g_1(y)\) and \(x=g_2(y)\) yields \[\int_{g_1(y)}^{g_2(y)}\dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial x} \, dx = Q(g_2(y),y)-Q(g_1(y),y).\] Integrating the resulting integrand over the interval \((c,d)\) we obtain \[\begin{align} \int_c^d\int_{g_1(y)}^{g_2(y)}\dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial x} \, dx \, dy &=\int_c^d \big(Q(g_2(y),y)-Q(g_1(y),y)\big) \, dy\\ &=\int_c^d (Q(g_2(y),y) \, dy -\int_c^d (Q(g_1(y),y) \, dy\\ &=\int_c^d (Q(g_2(y),y) \, dy +\int_d^c (Q(g_1(y),y) \, dy\\ &=\int_{C'_2} Q \, dy +\int_{C'_1} Q \, dy \\ &=\oint_{C} Q \, dy.\\ \end{align}\] Thus, we arrive at the second half of the required expression. \[\oint_{C} Q \, dy = \int_c^d\int_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)}\dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial x} \, dy \, dx= \iint_R \left(\dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial x}\right) \, dx \, dy.\] Summing both the results finishes the proof of Green's theorem: \[\begin{align} \oint_{C} P \, dx +\oint_{C} Q \, dy=\oint_C \mathbf F\cdot d\mathbf s &=\iint_R \left(-\dfrac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) \, dx \, dy +  \iint_R \left(\dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial x}\right) \, dx \, dy\\ &=\iint_R \left(\dfrac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\dfrac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) \, dx \, dy. \ _\square  \end{align}.\] Green's Functions in Physics Understanding Conservative vs. Non-conservative Forces Problem Loading...
