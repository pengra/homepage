Now, as with any machine learning approach, the other thing we’re going to need is a lot of data. Fortunately, this very website has an archive of thousands of reviews with album art and other metadata attached, so I’m using that as the training data for my neural network. It’s very much not perfectâsome albums are hard to classify, some are tagged with a whole pile of genres, and some are plain misclassified, so you’ll see some oddities in the data occasionallyâbut as long as most of it is accurate enough, we should be okay. We’ll start simple: we’ll see if we can train the neural network to tell the difference between brvtal/trve and unbrvtal album art. I think most fans can do this pretty easily, so let’s try the computer. For the purposes of this test, we’ll use the genre tags from the reviews, and define brvtal metal as anything which is death, black, doom, or grind, and unbrvtal metal as anything which is heavy, progressive, power, melodic, folk, post-, thrash, or a couple of others (Don’t @ me about how trve your favorite genre is: this is the division that gets the best results.). To my slight surprise, the neural network does very well here: with a data set of 3000 records split approximately equally into brvtal and unbrvtal categories, I got an accuracy of over 70%. The handy thing about the way this network is set up is that the classification result is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 is “not at all brvtal” and 1 is “completely brvtal”. This means we get a brvtality score and can ask it, say, what the most brvtal album art we’ve ever seen is. These albums on the other hand it thought were not brvtal, while the tagging indicated they were. Here, in I’m inclined to agree with the network’s calls rather than the label I got from the genre tags more often than not, especially on the albums it has identified as brvtal, so the network is doing pretty damn well. And these are the most death metal. And now, black metal records it thought were death. At this point I decided to try something harder. I think this was the original challenge from the Angry Metal Staff water cooler chatter: Can I teach the neural network to identify good records, as defined by the infallible Angry Metal Rating Scale? Unfortunately, the answer appears to be no. I played around a lot with how I partition the data and the parameters of the model, but I couldn’t get any results I was satisfied were significant. It’s also worth noting at this point that one of the other disadvantages of neural networks is it’s hard to tell where their results are coming from. What does the network identify in those album covers that mark them as brvtal? We can make some guesses by looking at the results, but there’s no obvious way of getting an actual explanation out of it. Sure enough, though, here are some death metal cats. What a scandal! At press time, Black Metal Cats had not responded to our request for comment. And with that question settled, my work here is done. Show 5 footnotes
