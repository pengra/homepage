Django is also a very active open-source project, with great new features and enhancements with each release. This, along with the framework being fairly large to begin with, makes it easy to miss cool features and techniques as they come out….like this one: Well, since Django 1.4 we now have a built in method for doing bulk inserts, and it goes a little something like this:  Fix this: Game.objects.bulk_create(bulk_games) Fixed – thanks! What about bulk saves? Is there a better solution rather than iterating the set of objects and saving one by one? You can just update an entire queryset with update(). So, for example, if you wanted to change all records that have the name Tim to Timothy in an Employee model, you could do: Employee.objects.filter(name="Tim").update(name="Timothy")
