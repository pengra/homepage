Over the years I’ve worked on many games, some big, some small. I’ve found that the smaller the game, the more fun I seem to have making it. So I set out to make the smallest game I possibly could, and it was a blast. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the smallest game I’ve ever released. I call it “Tiny Ski!”, and it’s 960 bytes of pure magic. Please watch this short demonstration and continue reading for more info and source code. To quote the great Ian Malcolm, “They were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.” There has to be another way. That’s why I say, instead of thinking big, we need to think small. So today, I am proposing a bold new direction. Imagine games so small that you can literally fit one in the palm of your hand. So, without further ado, weighing in at 960 bytes, I present my first entry into the business card game format, “Tiny Ski”! For those that don’t have access to Visual Studio (or are just lazy), don’t fret! I went to the trouble of building the game for you at no extra charge. This is only the beginning of our exploration into this new format. There is plenty of room for innovation. I look forward to seeing what you all can come up with! If you made or know of any games with source code that can fit on a business card, please post them below. I’m thinking about setting up a Business Card Game Jam on itch.io later this year, does that sound fun? Let me know! Thanks for reading all this. I also recently submitted a ton of really cool 1k programs to js1k, I will write much more about them in a future post. Until now, here are the best ones.. Ok, so most new programming technologies allow for bloatyer and shittier code because there is just more computing power. So how about someone designs some sort of protocol like nfc or qr that can only fit a credit card sized piece of code so that people are forced to think small again.
