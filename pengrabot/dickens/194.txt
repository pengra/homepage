It is doing what you wanted it to do. An example could be that function need to add two numbers, then you verify (like write unit test) that it is correctly doing that. Using the example of the function need to add two numbers verification need to confirm that this function is really what user need, eg. maybe you need to multiply two numbers. Then I had personal experience of why and how validation is hard. After a few days and I had it running in production and it was working, verification was successful, I every day I got all ads from the previous day. What was the problem? Rember that I wanted to get “I wanted all new ads per day to my email”, I wanted all “new ads per day”, but what I got was all updated and new ads per day. Let me explain. Every day I was getting around 200 ads per day and I noticed that a lot of them were the same ads, day after day. And they are doing this so that their ad is always on the first page, sometimes they even do it a few times per day (later I found out that a friend of a friend was contracted by one local real-estate agency to make software that will automatically update ads for them). I have solved this problem by making version two that could know if an ad is new or updated and if updated what was updated. This experience was fascinating to me. It gave me a practical understanding of why it is common that the end user is not happy with the finaly product. If validation of MVP is correct, then add additional features, if not cancel it I also understood why some companies hire domain experts consultants (just be sure to have a good one).
