When a victim opens the affected web page in a browser, the XSS attack payload is served to the victim’s browser as part of the HTML code (just like a legitimate comment would). This means that victims will end up executing the malicious script once the page is viewed in their browser. The second and the most common type of XSS is Reflected XSS (Non-persistent XSS). In this case, the attacker’s payload has to be a part of the request that is sent to the web server. It is then reflected back in such a way that the HTTP response includes the payload from the HTTP request. Attackers use malicious links, phishing emails, and other social engineering techniques to lure the victim into making a request to the server. The reflected XSS payload is then executed in the user’s browser. Reflected XSS is not a persistent attack, so the attacker needs to deliver the payload to each victim. These attacks are often made using social networks. Cross-site Scripting is a very old technique but XSS vulnerabilities remain one of the most common ones on the web. They are still mentioned by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) as one of the top-10 security risks.
