Highlights: To enable its customers’ participation in the Retail Liquidity Program (“RLP”) at the New York Stock Exchange,5 which was scheduled to commence on August 1, 2012, Knight made a number of changes to its systems and software code related to its order handling processes. These changes included developing and deploying new software code in SMARS. SMARS is an automated, high speed, algorithmic router that sends orders into the market for execution. A core function of SMARS is to receive orders passed from other components of Knight’s trading platform (“parent” orders) and then, as needed based on the available liquidity, send one or more representative (or “child”) orders to external venues for execution. It gets better: The best part is the fine: $12m, despite the resulting audit also revealing that the system was systematically sending naked shorts. [Edit: seems this was posted a little too quickly: the final loss was $460m and the code was dead for closer to 9 years, not 8]
