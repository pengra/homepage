Whether you plan to attend the UW or another college or university, credits earned through UWHS can help you get a jump-start on earning your college degree. The UW credits earned through UWHS transfer successfully to many other colleges and universities, both public and private, in the state of Washington and around the country. Studies and surveys consistently indicate that most students can successfully transfer credits earned through UWHS. However, some colleges and universities do not grant transfer credit for courses taken through UWHS. In addition, credit transfer success may depend on additional factors (e.g., grade, specific course). Before registering for UW credit, students should contact their prospective colleges to confirm whether or not credits earned through UWHS can transfer to those colleges. <
