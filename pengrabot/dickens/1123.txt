Security researchers pocketed over $20,000 for their efforts White hat hackers have found more than 40 bugs in blockchain and cryptocurrency platforms in the past 30 days, according to an investigation by Hard Fork. There is a silver lining though: none of the vulnerabilities appear to be particularly serious at first glance. Thirteen companies dealing with cryptocurrency and blockchain tech received a total of 43 vulnerability reports in the period between February 13 and March 13, as per bug reports submitted to vulnerability disclosure platform Hacker One. Among others, the list of affected platforms includes Coinbase, EOS issuer Block.one, Tezos, Brave, and Monero. It’s worth noting that some of these companies are only marginally involved with decentralized technology, so it’s possible some of these kinks might be unrelated to their cryptocurrency and blockchain functionalities. This appears to be the case for Brave browser. Despite the high number of reported bugs, security researchers received a total of $23,675 for their efforts. For the record, seven of the 43 vulnerability reports didn’t mention the value of the bounty awarded. Despite having received 12 bug reports, Unikrn distributed a total of $1,375 in bug bounties. As is often the case, most of these vulnerability reports are closed off from the public, so the details remain unknown. However, judging by the low bounties rewarded, chances are the identified flaws weren’t a huge cause for concern.
