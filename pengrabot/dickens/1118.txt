Craig Steven Wright, the man who has, on various occasions, claimed to be Bitcoin’s legendary creator (or creators) Satoshi Nakamoto is trying to build a cryptocurrency and blockchain patent empire. We wanted to delve deeper into the data to understand the true extent of his empire, so we widened our original search criteria to include ‘Wright’ and ‘nChain’ alongside the original terms. Typically, a patent application is published several months after it is first submitted to make the public aware of potential innovation in a particular space. The applications are published alongside a response from the International Search Authority (ISA) to give applicants an idea of what is innovative and what isn’t. Approval relies on whether or not the patent office deems it truly “innovative.” Our most recent analysis found WIPO had published 155 patents filed by Wright over the past 19 months – with the earliest publication date relating to August 31, 2017. If (and only if) the patents are approved, this would mean Craig has the monopoly on the use, production, and distribution of the patented idea, potentially making many in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry considerably uncomfortable. Year-on-year activity showed that WIPO published 35 of Wright’s patents in 2017. But 2018 proved to be an even better year, as 84 patents were published – more than double the amount of those made publicly available in 2017. Interestingly, Wright has had 36 applications published so far this year. If he continues to submit patents at the rate he did previously, it’s possible he’ll exceed the numbers obtained in previous years by the end of 2019.  The vast majority of Wright’s patent applications relate to blockchain technology. In fact, our search showed that the term ‘blockchain’ was used 114 times in patent titles. In stark contracts, ‘cryptocurrency‘ only featured six times. ‘Bitcoin‘ didn’t feature at all. Then, we dug a little deeper and our search revealed there were 10 instances of ‘smart contracts’. Meanwhile, the terms ‘digital asset’ returned 12 results. Wright has been quite open about his patent quest on Twitter, where he answers followers’ questions and shares his patent filing methodology. His activity has drawn criticism from industry pundits, who notoriously oppose the notion of intellectual property ownership, but it seems Wright is intent on patenting his ideas and isn’t scared to publicly acknowledge this.  It’s hard to estimate how much money Wright has spent on patent applications thus far because the costs change considerably from country to country (and even within a country). The cost of patenting an invention depends on various factors, including the nature of the invention, its complexity, the length of the application, possible objections raised during the process, and patent attorney’s legal fees. It’s also worth noting that once a patent is granted, holders are sometimes required to pay maintenance or renewal fees, typically on an annual basis. Patents filed abroad also incur official filing fees for every country in question, as well as translation costs, and the costs associated with using local patent agents. Interestingly, Wright filed 11 patent applications in Portuguese in Brazil. Published March 18, 2019 — 15:19 UTC March 18, 2019 — 15:19 UTC The Heart of Tech™ Thank you!
