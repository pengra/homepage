The World’s Most Advanced Data Center GPUs. NVIDIA partners offer a wide array of cutting-edge servers capable of diverse AI, HPC, and accelerated computing workloads. To promote the optimal server for each workload, NVIDIA has introduced GPU-Accelerated Server Platforms, which recommends ideal classes of servers for various Training (HGX-T), Inference (HGX-I), and Supercomputing (SCX) applications. Platforms align the entire data center server ecosystem and ensure that, when a customer selects a specific server platform that matches their accelerated computing application, they’ll achieve the industry’s best performance. Inference is where a trained neural network really goes to work. As new data points come in such as images, speech, visual and video search, inference is what gives the answers and recommendations at the heart of many AI services. A server with a single Tesla GPU can deliver 27X higher inference throughput than a single-socket CPU-only server resulting in dramatic cost savings. DOWNLOAD THE GPU-READY DATA CENTER TECH OVERVIEW HPC data centers need to support the ever-growing computing demands of scientists and researchers while staying within a tight budget. The old approach of deploying lots of commodity compute nodes substantially increases costs without proportionally increasing data center performance. The enterprise is transforming.Workflows are evolving and companies are needing to run high-end simulations and visualizations alongside modern business apps for all users and on any device.
