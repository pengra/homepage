While this concept is a bit challenging at first, you should be aware of the distinction between primitive and object. Essentially, there are methods and properties available to all strings, and in the background JavaScript will perform a conversion to object and back to primitive every time a method or property is called. Being able to access every character in a string gives us a number of ways to work with and manipulate strings. Using square bracket notation, we can access any character in the string. For both of these methods, you can also search for multiple characters in the string. It will return the index number of the first character in the instance. These two formatting methods take no additional parameters. It is worth noting that these methods do not change the original string. By splitting strings you can determine how many words are in a sentence, and use the method as a way to determine people's first names and last names, for example. Strings are one of the most frequently used data types, and there is a lot we can do with them. Simple setup. Full root access. Straightforward pricing.
