As of June 1, 2018, UW-Madison became one step closer to having Canvas as its single, centrally supported learning management system (LMS). Almost all courses – credit and noncredit – are now using Canvas, with D2L officially discontinued and Moodle turned off for all but a few identified exceptions, as well. Now in its final stages, the cross-campus effort is set to conclude in the early months of 2019. During that time, the transition team will continue working closely with a specific subset of courses still in need of two significant functionality solutions: content authoring and advanced quizzing. Faculty and instructors who have courses still affected by these identified gaps are being communicated with directly to ensure that the appropriate support is provided based on the transition team’s final recommendations.
