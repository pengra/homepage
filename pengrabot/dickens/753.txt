Pennsylvania is the poster child for gerrymandering. How did things get so bad? Three main reasons: In a fair district, which gives voters real choices at the ballot box and ensures that politicians are accountable, district lines are drawn to reflect community borders and natural boundaries (like rivers or mountains), and to create an accurate depiction of the population. Cracking reduces the voting power of a certain party or community by splitting its population and spreading its members among several districts where they become an irrelevant minority. Packing concentrates voters of one party or community in as few districts as possible to reduce their influence in the remaining districts. Prison-based gerrymandering counts incarcerated people, who are not allowed to vote, in the district where the prison is located, rather than in their home districts. This gives voters from districts with large prisons more influence than they should have. Consider Pennsylvania’s 7th Congressional District, nicknamed “Goofy kicking Donald.” It’s regularly described as one of the most gerrymandered districts in the country. As a result of gerrymandered districts: You’ll find similar stories across Pennsylvania. Follow the odd little squiggles, and you will see communities and counties divided, and voters deprived of choice and voice. We don’t have to let them. Bills have already been introduced in the PA House and Senate to establish an independent citizens commission, which will draw equitable lines that reflect real communities, free from partisan and financial influence.
