A Turing Machine is an accepting device which accepts the languages (recursively enumerable set) generated by type 0 grammars. It was invented in 1936 by Alan Turing. A Turing Machine (TM) is a mathematical model which consists of an infinite length tape divided into cells on which input is given. It consists of a head which reads the input tape. A state register stores the state of the Turing machine. After reading an input symbol, it is replaced with another symbol, its internal state is changed, and it moves from one cell to the right or left. If the TM reaches the final state, the input string is accepted, otherwise rejected. The following table shows a comparison of how a Turing machine differs from Finite Automaton and Pushdown Automaton. δ is given by − For a Turing machine, the time complexity refers to the measure of the number of times the tape moves when the machine is initialized for some input symbols and the space complexity is the number of cells of the tape written. Time complexity all reasonable functions − T(n) = O(n log n) TM's space complexity − S(n) = O(n) © Copyright 2019. All Rights Reserved.
