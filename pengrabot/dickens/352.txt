My experience studying computer science and HCDE has provided unique opportunities to           apply my diverse interests in science, engineering, and the arts towards solving           contemporary problems. My acdemic interests are fairly interdisciplinary, but I am           particularly interested in programming languages, computational biology, and complexity theory. I thrive on applying my passion for learning, problem-solving, and teaching                       to the various roles I've held in the field of engineering, from internships                       at local start-ups and a multi-national company (Expedia) to developing and                       teaching in the CSE department at the University of Washington. I have found my                     jack-of-all-trades nature to be especially useful in being able to approach                     problems in different applications, integrating different experiences and                     interests with one another. My future career goals involve teaching at a                     research-based university and/or pursing a full-time industry role in software                     engineering. I seek opportunities that present challenge and intellectual reward, welcome curiosity and ultimately make a difference in society. In my free time, Iâm either studying a new programming language, solving logic puzzles, or finding new things to learn, all with fresh coffee in hand and my four-legged friend at my side.

I lead course sections twice a week to a class of 15-20 students. My additional responsiblities include grading weekly homework assignments and course exams and helping students in the IPL (Introductory Programming Lab) outside of class. In Summer and Autumn quarters of 2016, I held additional Head TA roles designing weekly section curriculum for all sections, and have developed a class website to provide additional resources to help foster students interest in computer science and engineering. As the teaching assistant for UWâs Women in Computing Seminar, I help lead weekly sections to discuss the STEM community and recent diversity efforts, covering issues such as cognitive bias, importance of role models, research opportunities, and available career pathways and offering tech company fieldtrips and alumnae panels. In addition to section contribution, I have developed a course website to be used for the 2016-17 academic year offering students a number of different pre-engineering and STEM diversity resources. As part of the first REP team at UW, I helped plan, implement, and manage weekly educational programs for University of Washington students living on campus. These programs provided enrichment in the areas of academic success, wellness, and diversity and reached up to 70 students per program throughout the year. BuzzBee, a technology marketing agency in Seattle, has offered  excellent opportunities to apply my passion for technology with my interests in design and business development. Working alongside the strategic and creative departments (and their four-legged canine friends), I've had internal responsiblities finding and presenting client and competitive market research, blog authoring and maintence of the company website. Externally, I've developed email and web templates for some of our clients, including Hedvig, Cloudera and Microsoft and assisted with technical copywriting for reports, e-mail campaigns and web pages. Throughout my experience so far, I've developed a unique perspective of the development, growth and success of both established and emerging technology companies. Early Fall Start (EFS) is a program that draws in more than 600 incoming freshmen to the University of Washington on-campus residence halls during the month before the academic year starts. As a Community Leader (Resident Advisor), I helped support these students transitioning to starting college and living on campus. My responsibilities included marketing important information for students in the halls, planning and managing social and educational events, and responding to any issues students may have faced during their transition. As a CSE 311 Teaching Assistant (TA), I supported CSE 311 lecture content focused on introducing computational theory to CSE undergraduates. I lead course sections twice a week to a class of 15-20 students covering material including predicate logic, modular arithmetic, induction proof strategies, and finite state automata. My additional responsiblities grading weekly homework assignments and course exams and holding several office hours each week. As a CSE 332 Teaching Assistant (TA), I support CSE 332 lecture content focused on teaching advanced data structures, algorithms, and parallelism (Java) to CSE undergraduates. I lead course sections weekly to a class of 25-30 students covering material including data structure implementation, algorithm analysis, graphs, parallelism, and concerrency. My additional responsiblities grading weekly homework assignments and course exams and holding several office hours each week. As a 154 Teaching Assistant (TA), I supported CSE 154 lecture content which teaches Web Programming. This course introduces HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and SQL sequentially throughout the course and builds upon existing programming knowledge to build a variety of different web applications. I lead course sections and programming labs twice a week to a class of 15-20 students. My additional responsiblities include grading weekly homework assignments and course exams and helping students in the WPL (Web Programming Lab) outside of class. Working with a team of 3 other students and a CSE lecturer implementing a Chrome extension to improve the quality of grading 300-level proof assignments. This tool integrates with the current grading platform but aims at providing more comprehensive student feedback as well as consistency between different graders on assignments. Pure Home is an e-commerce company that specializes in personalizing home decor. As a growing start-up company in Seattle, Pure Home sparked my passion for working in technology start-ups. Starting as an intern, I quickly developed skills in search-optimized content writing for over a thousand home-decor products, regular article authoring and editing for the company's blog, social media account maintenance, and eventually earned a position as Marketing Assistant with responsibilities that included strategic market research and managing new and existing products on our e-commerce platform, Magento.
