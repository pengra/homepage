In the Lion Air crash, pilots reportedly had trouble with a new feature, added to account for the 737 Max's larger engines, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). It may have engaged erroneously, pushing the nose down and causing the plane to go into a dive. The pilots apparently fought the controls, but were unable to counter the problem. Boeing, in a very unusual procedure, issued an emergency bulletin ordering airlines to train pilots on how to shut off the automatic system. In today's news release, it said that it's always been possible to override it. "The pilot will always be able to override the flight control law using electric trim or manual trim," it said. "In addition, it can be controlled through the use of the existing runaway stabilizer procedure as reinforced in the Operations Manual Bulletin (OMB) issued on Nov. 6, 2018."
