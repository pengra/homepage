Average would be hard to find here, but if you're just looking for samples, I had AP credit for 142 and 3.4 in 143 (and a 3.3 in MATH 126). I did have strong science grades though. I was denied my first attempt and accepted my second, where I'd improved my math grades (3.7 in 307, 3.8 in 308) and put some serious work into my essay.
