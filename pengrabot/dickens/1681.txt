It's April in the UK, and you'd quite like to enjoy some online adult content. But before you can, you need to walk to your nearest retailer. You shuffle, hesitantly, toward the cashier, mindful of the other patrons, and mumble that you'd like to buy a porn license. As your gaze falls toward your shoes, the cashier responds, a little too loudly, if it's for Pornhub or somewhere else. The highly anticipated RPG/shooter may also be an Epic Games Store exclusive. Also: 'Our Planet,' 'Ultraman,' 'The Twilight Zone,' Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,' and 'You're the Worst.' Warp is a VPN for your mobile device. It's not going to compete with Apple or Samsung directly. Blackout will also be free from April 2nd-30th.
