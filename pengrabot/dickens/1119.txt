University campuses aren't just producing new college graduates. They're also churning out lots of cryptocurrency. This is probably due to opportunistic students who are creating mining rigs in their dorm rooms, according to Cisco threat researcher Austin McBride. "You leave [the mining rig] running in your dorm room for four years, you walk out of college with a big chunk of change," he said during a Monday talk at RSA.

"If you don't have to pay for those costs, then you are in a really good spot for making money on the university's dime." "Some of the systems that run our grids and other utilities are purpose build and do not get software and hardware updates as frequently as a Mac or PC would," he added. "So, there is more of a potential for vulnerabilities being unpatched for some time and this makes it an attractive target."
