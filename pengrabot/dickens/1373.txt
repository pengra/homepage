 Broadly speaking, quantum mechanics incorporates four classes of phenomena for which classical physics cannot account: In many aspects modern technology operates at a scale where quantum effects are significant. With the differential operator defined by The general solutions of the Schr√∂dinger equation for the particle in a box are A finite potential well is the generalization of the infinite potential well problem to potential wells having finite depth. The finite potential well problem is mathematically more complicated than the infinite particle-in-a-box problem as the wave function is not pinned to zero at the walls of the well. Instead, the wave function must satisfy more complicated mathematical boundary conditions as it is nonzero in regions outside the well. As in the classical case, the potential for the quantum harmonic oscillator is given by and the corresponding energy levels are This is another example illustrating the quantification of energy for bound states. The potential in this case is given by: The solutions are superpositions of left- and right-moving waves: and and Each term of the solution can be interpreted as an incident, reflected, or transmitted component of the wave, allowing the calculation of transmission and reflection coefficients. Notably, in contrast to classical mechanics, incident particles with energies greater than the potential step are partially reflected. The following titles, all by working physicists, attempt to communicate quantum theory to lay people, using a minimum of technical apparatus. More technical:
