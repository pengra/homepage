C++ ranks 4th in popularity according to 2016 IEEE spectrum Top Programming Language ranking. Learning C++ is a wise investment for all programmers. This guide answers all your questions related to C++ on what is it, when is it used, why is it used and how to get yourself started with it. “C++ is a statically-typed, free-form, (usually) compiled, multi-paradigm, intermediate-level general-purpose middle-level programming language.” Many of today’s operating systems, system drivers, browsers and games use C++ as their core language. This makes C++ one of the most popular languages today. While Bjarne Stroustrup was working in AT&T Bell Labs in 1979, he faced difficulties in analyzing UNIX kernel for distributed systems. The current languages were either too slow or too low level. So, he set forward to create a new language. For building this language, he chose C. Why C? Because it is a general purpose language and is very efficient as well as fast in its operations. He used his knowledge of object-oriented model from SIMULA and began working on class extensions to C. His aim was to create a language with far higher level of abstraction while retaining the efficiency of C. This new programming language was named C withClasses, but was later renamed to C++ (++ refers to the increment operator in C). When C++ was first released in 1985, there were no official standards released. It was only until 1998 that C++ was first standardized which was known as C++98. The next major standard for C++ was released in 2011 and it was named C++11. Since, C++ committee was sure this update would be released within 2009, they unofficially named it C++0x. Later, when they didn’t, Stroustrup joked that C++0x went hexadecimal - C++0xB (C++11). Nice save. C++14 is the current iteration of C++ released in 2014. Like C++03, it included mainly bug fixes and simple improvements to C++11. The supposedly next iteration to C++ which is planned to be rolled out in 2017. It is expected to have many new features. Most of the features planned for this version are already completed. Being a general-purpose language, C++ is undoubtedly feature-rich. Going through all the features will take you some time but, as a beginner, below are the most important features you should know. This is one of those questions you need to ask before starting any programming language. It helps you understand the scope of the language, the real world usability and how far you can get with it in terms of support. Here are 5 reasons why you should learn C++. Now that you know what C++ is and how vast its scope ranges to, it’s time to get started with it. But, before you start, there are a couple of important things you should know. Below are the 4 most important things you need to know. C++ is completely free and readily available on all platforms. Follow the tutorial below for running C++ on your computer. There are multiple compilers and text editors you can use to run C++ programming. These may differ from system to system. If you want a quick start, you can also run C++ program online. The most effortless way to program C++ has to be online and there are several online compilers to choose from. To run C++ programming in Ideone.com, select C++ language at the bottom of the editor, write your code and click Run. I don’t recommend using online compilers other than testing as it is very limited in use (you can’t work with files or take inputs from user). To unlock the full potential of C++, it’s recommended to install compiler and run C programs from your system. Here’s is the easiest way to run C++ programming in your system (Mac OSX, Windows and Linux) that suit a beginner’s purpose. The easiest way to run C++ Programming in Mac OS X is by downloading XCode. To run C++ programming on Linux, you need: Here’s a step by step guide to run C++ in Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Fedora, Redhat and Scientific Linux): Finally, you can see the output using following command. As you might have imagined, you need to use the name of executable file you chose before. Also, you need to use path to the execute file if you are in a different directory. To run C++ Programming in Windows, you’d need to download Code::Blocks. There are others available as well but Code::Blocks makes installation a piece of cake. It’s easy, simple and developer friendly. To make this procedure even easier, follow this step by step guide. Now you have installed the compiler based on your OS, it’s time to write your first C++ program. Your first C++ program will be a “Hello World!” program. You might have noticed “Hello World!” being the first program while starting out with any programming language. This is because: So, let’s get coding. Now, let’s dissect the above code. The code is divided into six major parts: Now that you’ve grasped the basics of starting out on C++, you should aim to expand on it with good tutorials and dedication from your side. The tutorials are designed for beginners absolute who do not have any prior knowledge of C++ programming (or, any other programming languages). Our tutorials will provide you the perfect platform to enhance your programming skills and apply it to real life. It is a must for you to have a good book in hand if you want to better yourself in programming. It won’t just familiarize you with the programming language itself but also teach you to write good code, follow standard principles and understand core programming concepts. Here are the top 2 books we feel is best for you. The book provides complete guide to C++ language, its features, and the design techniques used. It is authored by the creator of C++ himself, Bjarne Stroustrup. The best book for beginners. It assumes no previous programming experience before and gives you the complete picture of C++ while starting out. A must have. A must for writing clean and efficient C++ programs. The book is intended to provide beginners with necessary rules, guidelines and coding practices.  As you consume more content on C++, you’ll gradually understand there is no one way to get something done. Learning by doing Follow C++ standards Read others C++ code Break things Join C++ communities C++ is a great language to start your programming journey with. The experience will take you a long way in becoming a great developer. So why wait. Get started by visiting any of the tutorials below. Get latest updates, articles and tutorials on C++ programming.
