will compute square roots.  This is how your calculator does it  internally. Mathematicians are often very happy when, after a great deal of  work, they are just able to say that a solution to a problem exists.  This is because once they know it exists, there might be some nice  method, such as Newton's Method, to actually compute the solution. Now use the graph to make  another initial guess which will lead to the solution.
