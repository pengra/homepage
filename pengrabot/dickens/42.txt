See where our graduates end up after studying Greek, Latin and classical civilizations with us. Our department sponsors dozens of lectures every year featuring scholars from around the world. Discover politics, literature, history, art and archaeology with a major or minor in our department. Add some intrigue to your schedule and fulfill GE requirements by taking a Classics course this spring. Classicists take an active part in the humanistic enterprise. The long history of our discipline continues to be enriched by new interpretive tools. We study the languages and cultures of the ancient Greeks and Romans, whose civilizations shape our present cultural, intellectual, professional, and civic lives. Our students develop deeply informed critical perspectives and excellent analytical, problem-solving, and communication skills. They pursue careers in education, law, journalism, business and entrepreneurship, and health sciences. Every student at UW can benefit by adding Latin, Greek, or Classical Studies to their university education. Learn more View all events
