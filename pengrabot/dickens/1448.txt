Hey guys, Is there any official site selling a poster or a printable cheatsheet for VIM? Hi all, So I was wondering if Vim could replicate the main functionality of such a tool. By that  I mean the ability to call python functions in a user-defined order and for every modification show a preview to the user before it finally renames the files. If it's possible could someone please give some directions how it can be done? I am currently using YCM for autocompletion. Being that I work with many different languages, this seems to be one of the obvious choices. However, I would ideally like YCM to complete function parameters when the completion is selected, but this doesn't seem to be an option. What are some alternatives that can provide this functionality? Version: 8.1 terminal 76.5k Subscribers 168 Online For Vim enthusiasts and anyone interested in Vim.
