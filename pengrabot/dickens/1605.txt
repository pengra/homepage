We bring the best of Google to innovative nonprofits that are committed to creating a world that works for everyone. Education More than half of the books published in India are written in Hindi and English. But in a country with dozens of local languages, this means many students donât have access to books in their native tongue. Google.org is supporting Pratham Books to rapidly expand the reach of their translation platform StoryWeaver. Economic Opportunity Millions of job seekers rely on Americaâs publicly funded workforce system, but the process is often confusing and disheartening. Google.org is supporting Code for America to build technologies that help job seekers easily access the resources they need. Inclusion Shifting a nationâs mindset means collecting and surfacing lost data: the thousands of lost records and stories of racial injustice. Google.org is working with Bryan Stevensonâs Equal Justice Initiative, which is building a national memorial to lynching victims and a museum that examines African American history. Sundar Pichai, our CEO, recently announced a number of ways Google is working to create more opportunity for everyone, including a 5-year goal to award $1 billion in grants and contribute 1 million employee volunteer hours. We want a world that works for everyoneâand we believe technology and innovation can move the needle in three key areas. {[article.published_at|date:'longDate']} {[article.title]} Follow Us
