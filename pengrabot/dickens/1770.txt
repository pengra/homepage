The IEX API is a set of services offered by The Investors Exchange (IEX) to provide access to data from the Exchange to developers and engineers for free. It can be used to build high-quality apps and services. Weâre always working to improve the IEX API. Please check back for enhancements and improvements. If you redistribute our API data: The IEX API is currently open and does not require authentication to access its data. To provide the best experience for all our users, we monitor for suspicious activity and overload. We reserve the right to revoke access to anyone who abuses the IEX API. We throttle endpoints by IP, but you should be able to achieve over 100 requests per second.
