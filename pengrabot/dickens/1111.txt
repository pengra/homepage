St. Petersburg, which went live immediately after Constantinople, essentially undoes one of Constantinople's upgrades, which was found to be a security risk. Major upgrades (also called hard forks) of blockchain-based systems such as Ethereum can be tricky as they require participants on the network to switch to new software. If they don't, the fork becomes contentious â€” the blockchain splits in two with some users switching to the new version and some staying on the old one. Constantinople and St. Petersburg were activated at block height 7,280,000 or roughly at 8pm UTC on Thursday. More than 3,700 blocks were mined on Ethereum since then, and everything points to the fork going as planned.
