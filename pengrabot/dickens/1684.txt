OCTOMOM SAYS MANAGER FORCED HER INTO PORN, FERTILITY DOCTOR LIED TO HER The 43-year-old says it costs $5,000/month to run her household and she only receives $1,500 worth of food stamps from the government, which is why she turned to porn in 2012 because it was the "only industry" that accepted her. NADYA SULEMAN WANTS TO SHAKE &aposOCTOMOM&apos PERSONA "I couldn&apost provide any more," she said in an interview with "Sunday Night," an Australian show. "The interviews weren&apost coming as much and I couldn&apost work full time. I had too many little kids." Suleman said she made $8,000. "I sold my soul to the devil — temporarily," she added. Partaking in porn then led Suleman to stripping onstage but she soon stopped when she found her 10-year-old daughter playing with her stripper high-heels. "I picked the heel up and I threw it," she said. "It actually stuck in the screen. All of what I had suppressed — the anger, the resentment towards myself, the resentment towards the world, towards other people, towards women, and the shame I towards myself it bubbled and boiled up into rage."

She now works as a part-time counselor and struggles to make ends meet, but she acknowledges her "children are my responsibility."
