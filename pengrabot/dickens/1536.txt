A zero-day vulnerability, at its core, is   a flaw. It is an unknown exploit in the wild that exposes a   vulnerability in software or hardware and can create complicated   problems well before anyone realizes something is wrong. In fact, a   zero-day exploit leaves NO opportunity for detection ... at first. A zero-day attack happens once that flaw,   or software/hardware vulnerability, is exploited and attackers release   malware before a developer has an opportunity to create a patch to fix   the vulnerability—hence “zero-day.” Let’s break down the steps of the   window of vulnerability: Once a patch is written and used, the   exploit is no longer called a zero-day exploit. These attacks are   rarely discovered right away. In fact, it often takes not just days   but months and sometimes years before a developer learns of the   vulnerability that led to an attack. An explanation of zero-day vulnerabilities, how cyber attacks target them, and what you can do to protect your business.
