Show of hands if you can off of the top of your head remove/trim a character from the start or end of a string. If your hand remained down, don’t feel too bad. There are so many string manipulation methods in Javascript, it can be confusing. In this weeks lesson of, “You probably already know this, but some people might not”, we are going to be removing characters from the beginning and end of strings. Riveting stuff, right? Want to remove the first character from a string? Just bump the number up if you want to remove more than one character from the beginning of the string. What if you wanted to remove a character from the beginning of a string as well as from the end at the same time? Because of the way string methods work, they are chainable. A shorter way is myString.slice(1, -1). This gives both the start and end index to the slice call. sillyString =myString .substring(1,myString .length – 1); depends on the needs you can pass first and last argument  here pass 1 for remove first and last What if i want to remove first [ and last ] from the array string which has [ in start and last value gets closed ]. I have tried multiple options to replace them with space but its not working For remove the first character and last character you can also do this : `var sillyString = myString.slice(1, -1)` In the entire article, `substr` (which I’ve seen in some places as “not recommended” and “pseudo-deprecated”) can be replace with “slice” substr is deprecated and the best replacement is substring I just want to return “Everything” so I’d like to remove all characters after the ~, including the ~. What would this look like?
