A script is an executable list of commands like macro or batch file created by a scripting language. Scripts (like PHP, Perl) which are executed on a web server are called server-side scripts and scripts (like JavaScript) which are executed on user's computer, interpreted by the browser is called client-side scripts. What is JavaScript ? It was first released under the name of LiveScript as part of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995. It was renamed JavaScript on December 4, 1995. As JavaScript works on the client side, It is mostly used for client-side web development. JavaScript is designed for use on web pages and closely integrated with HTML. JavaScript can create applications which run in the browsers such as IE, Opera, FireFox, Google Chrome and other. Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International for standardization resulting in the standardized version named ECMAScript. JavaScript and Java JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally they are different. Java is a programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. and JavaScript is a scripting language developed by Netscape. Java is a server-side and static type language. JavaScript is a client-side, dynamically typed language. Java programs are compiled on the server and run on almost every platform without distribution of source code whereas scripts written in JavaScript are placed inside a HTML document and interpreted by the browser. The syntax, reserved-words of JavaScript and Java are also different. JavaScript compares to Java Features of the w3resource JavaScript Tutorial In this series of tutorials, we have covered JavaScript 1.5+ in detail. While creating this, we have taken care that learners can master the basics of JavaScript. Here is a list of features we have included in all of the chapters :
