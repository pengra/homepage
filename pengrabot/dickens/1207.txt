 The core syntax of C# language is similar to that of other C-style languages such as C, C++ and Java. In particular: Some notable features of C# that distinguish it from C,    C++, and Java where noted, are: The C# language does not allow for global variables or functions. All methods and members must be declared within classes. Static members of public classes can substitute for global variables and functions. Methods in programming language are the members of a class in a project, some methods have signatures and some don't have signatures. Methods can be void or can return something like string, integer, double, decimal, float and bool. If a method is void it means that the method does not return any data type. Both type categories are extensible with user-defined types. Example: What will display on the program is: Each line has a purpose: another useful library is the System.Drawing library An example of what it can do: This will create an image that is identical to that stored in "Image.png". In July 2005, ECMA submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1, via the latter's Fast-Track process, the standards and related TRs. This process usually takes 6â€“9 months.
