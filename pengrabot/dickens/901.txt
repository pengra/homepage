The embodiment of genius and the pre-eminent scientist of the modern age, his theories and discoveries have profoundly affected the way people view and understand the world and their place in it. Einstein was also known as a philosopher and humanist who was keenly interested in and concerned about the affairs of the world. His sagacious, wise, and humorous quotations, letters, and articles are widely used throughout popular culture as well as in historical and academic works. Einsteinâs name and image are instantly recognizable everywhere in the world. biography Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist and the most famous scientist in human history. He developed the general theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics, alongside quantum mechanics. He is perhaps best known in popular culture for his mass/energy equivalence formula E=mc2. In 1921 he received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his âservices to theoretical physicsâ, and in particular his discovery of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the evolution of quantum theory. Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany on March 14, 1879. As a child, he exhibited an extraordinary curiosity for and understanding of the mysteries of science. The young Einstein also took music lessons, playing both violin and piano; stoking a passion for music that he maintained throughout his life. Moving first to Italy and then Switzerland, the young prodigy graduated from high school in 1896. In 1905, while working as a patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland, Einstein had what came to be known as his âAnnus Mirabilisâ (miracle year). It was during this time that the young physicist obtained his Doctorate degree and published four of his most influential research papers, including the Special Theory of Relativity, the Photoelectric Effect, Brownian Motion, and Mass/Energy Equivalence, and his worldwide fame was assured. In 1915, Einstein completed his General Theory of Relativity, and brought to the world a fuller understanding of the interaction of space, time and gravity. Einstein emigrated to the United States in 1933. He accepted a professorship in Princeton, New Jersey at the prestigious institute for Advanced Study. He remained active in scientific, political and social matters until he passed away in 1955 at the age of 76. In 1999 Albert Einstein was recognized by TIME Magazine as the âPerson of the Centuryâ. Einsteinâs intellect, along with his wise and passionate dedication to the causes of social justice and pacifism, left humanity with a fuller understanding of its place in the universe and with pioneering moral guidance for future generations. visit the official einstein store Is your company interested in using Albert Einstein for any commercial purpose, including advertising and merchandise?
