Try this experiment - for a week, take some notes of the emails and all kinds of notifications that you receive that you react and answer to. Once the week is done, ask yourself these two question: Here are some of the proactive steps I took to reclaim my time and attention: There is an inbox rule that I created, that, in my opinion, works really well in determining the top-priority conversations: The inbox rule allowed me to set time aside in the day when I focus on answering email, for any questions, concerns, ideas and meeting invites. All other time is focused on building a great product. If you are using an iPhone, there is a wonderful capability that allows minimizing distractions to a minimum - “Do not disturb”. In this mode, you can still get notifications on your screen, however no buzzing or any other sounds will be made either through the device itself or the smart watch you connected it to. When declining the meeting, it’s reasonable to ask the person to discuss the action items over email. Yes, yes, the old adage about having a plan still applies, and, to the surprise of no one, works quite well. For a lot of the above, it will all come down to building both the necessary habits as well as a structured schedule to follow around the outlined practices. There are, of course, more ways to spend your professional time efficiently, and I am curious to hear your thoughts on what is the best way you organize your time. Back to posts
