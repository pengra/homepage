A finite state machine is a model of a reactive system. The model defines a finite set of states and behaviors and how the system transitions from one state to another when certain conditions are true. A finite state machine is used to model complex logic in dynamic systems, such as automatic transmissions, robotic systems, and mobile phones. Examples of operations containing complex logic include: A finite state machine can be represented by state charts. State charts provide additional capabilities beyond traditional finite state machines, such as: You can also select a web site from the following list: Select the China site (in Chinese or English) for best site performance.
