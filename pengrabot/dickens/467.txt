GitHub is home to over 31 million developers working together to host and review code, manage projects, and build software together. Use Git or checkout with SVN using the web URL. Go back Go back Go back Go back There are many great reinforcement learning frameworks on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that was light and small enough to let me fork it and add my own algorithms while still feeling in control. I thus created Bezos, a very light RL framework which implements all the boring things so that you don't have to. The framework uses Pytorch to do all the deep learning stuff, numpy, and OpenAI Gym Bezos has been designed to be configured before each run with a YAML file. Some examples of those YAML config files can be found in the configs folder. If you want to know what a parameter does (they are all self explanatory) check the source :)
