There is a distinction between the conditional operators && and || and the boolean operators & and |. Mainly it is a difference of precendence (which operators get evaluated first) and also the && and || are 'escaping'. This means that is a sequence such as... If cond1 is false, neither cond2 or cond3 are evaluated as the code rightly assumes that no matter what their value, the expression cannot be true. Likewise... If cond1 is true, neither cond2 or cond3 are evaluated as the expression must be true no matter what their value is. The bitwise counterparts, & and | are not escaping. Hope that helps. Example: Then X will be true when either A and B are true or if C is true or if D is not true (i.e. false). I'm not sure if this answers your question, but for example: Use '&&' for AND and use '||' for OR, for example: If you want logical operation answers are already given. && it's operation return true only if both operand it's true  which implies || it's operation return true if one or both operand it's true which implies if You write in result you have Therefore, the which I wrote above is used with respect to every pair of bits many answers above, i will try a different way: if you are looking for bitwise operations use only one of the marks like: 3 & 1 //==1 - and 4 | 1 //==5 - or Thanks for contributing an answer to Stack Overflow!
