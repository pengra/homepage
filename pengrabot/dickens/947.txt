\(\newcommand{\sech}{\mathop{\rm sech}\nolimits} \newcommand{\csch}{\mathop{\rm csch}\nolimits}\) Many mathematical problems involve solving equations. And while linear equations can be solved rather easily, nonlinear ones cannot. A nonlinear equation can always be written as \begin{equation} \label{eq:non-linear:function}   f(x)=0 \end{equation} For a suitably chosen function \(f\). For example, if we want to find \(x\) so that \(\tanh(x)=x/3\), we could instead chose \(f(x)=\tanh(x)-x/3\) and solve equation (1). Finding solutions to (1) is called "root-finding" (a "root" being a value of \(x\) for which the equation is satisfied). Iterative methods entail doing the exact same thing over and over again. This is perfect for a computer. The actual iteration starts from an approximation \(x_n\) at the \(n-\)th step and defines the next one,  \(x_{n+1}\) : \begin{equation}   \label{eq:2}   x_{n+1}=x_n-\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \end{equation} Notice that not only do we need to evaluate the function \(f\) at \(x_n\), but also we need to evaluate the derivative, \(f'(x_n)\). This could be a problem if the derivative is unknown, or complicated to compute (and there are other methods to use in that case). For example, we look at a function for which there is no formula for the solution: \(f(x)=\tanh(x) - x/3\) (we are looking for a non-zero solution). Since \(\tanh'(x)=\frac{1}{\cosh^2(x)}=\sech^2(x)\), the update rule becomes: \begin{equation}   \label{eq:3}   x_{n+1}=x_n-\frac{\tanh(x_n)-x_n/3}{\sech^2(x_n)-1/3}. \end{equation} We can do this manually by starting somewhere (not zero): So we can write To see the functions we are working with, we can do a nice little plot: *Also referred to as the Newton-Raphson Method.
