A conference for every React developer where women take the stage In this workshop We'll explore all the advanced techniques for making flexible and maintainable React components. We'll see how using popular patterns like Compound Components, Controlled Components, Render Props, Function As A Child etc. can help us in simplifying stuff, making our components more reusable. If time permits we will also cover React Hooks - hype driven development in the React Ecosystem. Learn to build fullstack applications in a day using GraphQL and Apollo in this practical, fast-paced course. Starting with the schema, students will create a GraphQL API using Apollo Server 2.0. Then we’ll use this data within a React user interface using Apollo Client and React Apollo. The course will feature a range of hands-on activities and labs to ensure that students can take these skills back to their own projects right away. Topics will include: You will need a laptop and a working knowledge of JavaScript and React to get the most out of the course, but the GraphQL concepts you’ll learn will apply to any environment. 30 Euston Square, London NW1 2FB Euston, Euston Square The venue provides step-free access, and additional assistance for anyone who requires it Thank you to our partners and sponsors for investing into our diverse engineering community: Join the conversation with 300 React developers discussing the future of react.
