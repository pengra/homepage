Desmosâ€™ user interface. See the cursor? Thatâ€™s where most ofÂ the magic happens! Traditionally, the most popular functions are the ones expressed in terms of $x$, which can be typed into a command line as follows: \begin{align*} y = \text{some algebraic expressions in terms of }x \end{align*} By reversing the roles of $x$ and $y$, functions in terms of $y$ can also be typed out into a command line as follows: \begin{align*} x = \text{some algebraic expressions in terms of }y \end{align*} Yep. Itâ€™s a full house. Just type in the trig functions using the above names! Polar curves and compound functions in action! Derivative and Integral Functions. Line 2 and Line 3 refer to the same function by the way. \begin{align*} y \ (\text{or }x) = \{ \text{condition 1}: \text{definition 1}, \text{condition 2}: \text{definition 2}, \ldots \} \end{align*} \begin{align*} f(x) = \begin{cases} -1 &Â x<0 \\ 0 & x=0 \\ 1 & x>0 \end{cases} \end{align*} then this would be the expression we want to type into theÂ command line: \begin{align*} f(x)=\left\{x<0:-1, x=0:0, x>0:1\right\} \end{align*} which should produce the following figure: The sign function. Note that Line 1 and Line 2 are equivalent. All right. So far so good?Â Hereâ€™s a figure illustratingÂ how implicit functions and parametric equations work out in Desmos: To get it started, hereâ€™s a list of inequalities you can tryÂ out andÂ get the juice flowing: And hereâ€™s what happened when we throw inÂ these inequalities into Desmos. AÂ Â diverse range of inequalities in Desmos. which is pretty cool. And thatâ€™s just aÂ start! \begin{align*} \text{equation/inequality} \, \{ \text{condition 1}\}\{ \text{condition 2} \} \ldots Â \end{align*} \begin{align*} y=x^2 \, \{ x>0 \} \end{align*} Of course, the restriction could have been an inequality onÂ $y$ as well, as in the graph of the function $x^2$ where $y$ is restricted to the interval $[5,15]$: \begin{align*} y=x^2 \, \{ 5 \le y \le 15 \} \end{align*} or perhaps an inequality concerning both $x$ and $y$: \begin{align*} y=x^2 \, \{ x+y<5 \}\{x>0\}Â \end{align*} Sounds a bit obscure? Hereâ€™s a picture for more info: A showcase of graph segmentation. Note that only the relevant variables can be used in the restriction clauses. Hmm, what are we talking about here? Hereâ€™s an accompanying picture to help us out: Woah! What is this!? A figure with 10 quadratic functions. Not our fingerprint. Using the slider trick, we manage to nail down the root of the cubic function $x^3+x+1$ up to 6 decimals. Note that the root from the graph is only accurate up to 4 decimals. In fact, one can also create a list where the members are listed implicitly but with a non-trivial increment (as inÂ $[2,7, \ldots, 42]$), whereÂ the increment can be made to be as big as $5635$, or as small as $0.01$ â€” a flexibility which makesÂ Desmos a powerful tool for defining aÂ largeÂ set of numbers. All of which are exemplified in the figure below: List definition, list transformation, simultaneous graphing and list-related computation. \begin{align*} \gcd (\text{number 1}, \ldots, \text{number n}) \end{align*} A list of miscellaneous functions available from the Desmos keyboard menu In a similar manner, we can also compute: For example, letâ€™s say that youÂ want to estimate the value of the infinite series $\displaystyle \frac{1}{1^2}+\frac{1}{2^2}+\cdots$, then one of the things you can do is to type something like this into the command line: \begin{align*} \sum_{i=1}^{1000} \frac{1}{i^2} \end{align*} Watch as Desmos performs some lightning-fast calculations your brain will never be able to!

There is no innate function for x-intercept for good reason â€” because a function or an equation can have 0 or multiple copies of them. However, all is not lost though, as Desmos will display the coordinates of the x-intercepts if you click on them on the graph. The coordinates are up to a few decimal points of accuracy, and you can type them into the field if you want to.
