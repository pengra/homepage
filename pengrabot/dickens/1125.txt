"To do this, the first step is to empower as many people as possible to get access to cryptocurrency. Since most of the money in the world is tied up in the traditional financial system, this means we need to connect to that system and be compliant with all laws and regulations as a financial service business." The addition of Neutrino would help Coinbase implement "a know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) program," he said, which would rely heavily on analytics. But with the acquisition, Coinbase also acquired Neutrino CEO Giancarlo Russo, Chief Technology Officer Alberto Ornaghi, and Chief Research Officer Marco Valleri. All three previously worked for HackingTeam. While a Coinbase representative sent BreakerMag a statement that the company had examined Neutrino's connections to HackingTeam as part of its due diligence, Anderson said in his blog post that "we had a gap in our diligence process. While we looked hard at the technology and security of the Neutrino product, we did not properly evaluate everything from the perspective of our mission and values as a crypto company." As a result of a review of the impact of the acquisition, Armstrong said that Coinbase's executives "together with the Neutrino team have come to an agreement: those who previously worked at Hacking Team (despite the fact that they have no current affiliation with Hacking Team), will transition out of Coinbase."
