Q&A for work. A dedicated place to share your teamâ€™s knowledge. The actual code: The prefix "@" enables the use of keywords as identifiers, which is   useful when interfacing with other programming languages. The   character @ is not actually part of the identifier, so the identifier   might be seen in other languages as a normal identifier, without the   prefix. An identifier with an @ prefix is called a verbatim   identifier. The code you posted is valid because this is allowed by the language specification, albeit discouraged. [Note: Use of the @ prefix for identifiers that are not keywords is   permitted, but strongly discouraged as a matter of style. end note] (@class, for example, os mainly used in razor views for specifying css class. Otherwise, avoid using such names :) Read session variables: @Session["something"] Access Html helper methods @Html.RenderPartial("someview","somecontroller"); Do exactly what you have in the question(though personally I think it's bad practice) @ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["whatever"]; Thanks for contributing an answer to Stack Overflow!
