A show about technology in business, research, and art. This podcast has been a guiding light as an entrepreneur in technology. The insights Craig and the team are able to pull out of a wide array of founders has helped shaped my approach to product development, leadership and fundraising. As someone who hopes to join a future YC batch this is an essential starting point to get in the right mindset for navigating life as a founder. A couple times in life you make a discovery thinking, "Is this too good to be true?" And then, after time, you realize, "I've discovered a jewel, a hidden treasure, that's better than I thought." That's what you'll find w/ Y Combinator's podcast. Every episode offers several pieces of insight, wisdom, advice, counsel, inspiration and/or guidance you couldn't possibly receive unless you were fortunate enough to hang with these leaders all the time. Regardless of where you are in the start-up process, Y Combinator's podcast will leave you smarter, stronger, and more inclined to keep moving forward with clarity and purpose. I've been advising leaders for over 30 years and know that inexperience relies on force, where experience is about accuracy; Y Combinator's podcast will help you get closer to hitting the bullseye every single time. Craig and team always do a great job on this podcast. The guests are interesting, the production quality is top notch. I definitely recommend it!
