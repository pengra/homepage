Experimental geometry labs creates an environment ripe for students and faculty to treat pure mathematics as a laboratory science.  Visualization and computational pattern discovery help guide research, formulate conjectures, and develop ideas in proofs.  In addition to research, experimental geometry labs foster community engagement via grassroots outreach activities in local schools, libraries, and museums. These activities spread the wonder and excitement of mathematics to people both within and outside the academy. Come participate in Geometry Labs United 2017 to learn more about labs and how to create your own. Sessions take place in: © 2019 University of Washington  |  Seattle, WA
