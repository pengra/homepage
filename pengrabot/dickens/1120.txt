It's an employment arms race You should definitely be there “Senior Software Engineer” and “Blockchain Developer” are the second and third most common job titles. The rest are all familiar household names like IBM, Ernst & Young (EY), Oracle, Accenture, Deloitte, and PwC. Of course, these aren’t traditionally related to blockchain, but are all starting to get into the game. As we look further down the list, more understandable names like Ripple, and ConsenSys appear. That said, less than half of the companies in the top 20 are dedicated blockchain startups or directly related to cryptocurrency. It’s also worth bearing in mind that Glassdoor is an English-centric website which may skew the results somewhat. But even so, in the English-speaking world, the US is dominating with blockchain employment, and only a small fraction of the jobs are even related to cryptocurrency.
