Our programs help UW students realize their potential — at the University and beyond. We provide a space for all students to be included, challenged and supported in their educational journey. CLUE is the UW's free multidisciplinary study center located in Mary Gates Hall, Commuter and Transfer Commons (CTC) and Othello Commons. Drop-in tutoring is available in Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Math, Writing, Statistics, Computer Science & Engineering, and Economics. Discussion sections are a way for you to review class material by doing discussions and practice questions with peers in the same class. Bring in your writing at whatever stage from brainstorming to the final draft to the CLUE Writing Center. Open Sunday through Thursday from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. Exam review sessions cover course material and strategies for specific tests in many of the UW's most challenging and popular courses. Want help with your time management skills, goal-setting, and study strategies? Our academic success coach is available to help you get where you want to be and overcome challenges that impede your success in college. Academic Support Programs creates transformative educational experiences to help undergraduates thrive academically at the University of Washington. Committed to a diverse and inclusive university, we develop varied models of support to help all our students succeed. These models include a multidisciplinary study center (The Center for Learning and Undergraduate Enrichment, or CLUE), challenging and supportive academic achievement courses, tutoring and mentorship programs, and collaboration with campus partners. We believe in the potential of all students at the University of Washington — and that educational support, which includes compassion, commitment, equity and patience — can help students realize this potential.
