Patents have always been controversial in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space because most projects are established on the premise of decentralization and open source code. It’s for this very reason that the notion of intellectual property (IP) is incredibly contentious. We wanted to get a better idea about the amount of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related patents filed and published across the globe to identify key trends and gather information on the most active entities in the space. In order to do this, Hard Fork gathered the World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO) website data using the following search terms: blockchain, block chain, Bitcoin, virtual currencies, virtual currency, digital currencies, digital currency, digital token, and smart contract. In fact, the data shows that the publication of patent started taking off in 2012, with the numbers staying around the same levels until 2015.  Next, we drilled down the data by country. China ranked top, with 790 patents published. This was closely followed by the US, where 762 patent applications were published. South Korea and Australia came next with 161 and 132, respectively. The United Kingdom was the only European nation to make the top 10 with 36 patents published. We also looked at which companies were most active in the space. The rest of the list was largely dominated by technology giants and financial services firms such as IBM (119), Mastercard (111), Coinplug (84), and Alibaba (60). Interestingly, two Chinese universities did make the list, although their activity paled in comparison to that of other entities. Our analysis also looked at the most prolific individuals. Yao Qian, the director of the People’s Bank of China Digital Currency Research Institute, has had 51 patents published. Other submissions came from Cong Zhang, Yang Yang, Joon-Sun Uhr, Zhiyong Tan, and Ying Chan. As part of our analysis, we also looked at the possible disparity in terms of cryptocurrency and blockchain-related patents. In contrast, only 260 submissions contained ‘crypto’, ‘virtual currency,’ or ‘digital currency.’ According to our analysis, 2019 might surpass 2018’s activity if submissions continue to trickle in. If inventors keep filing patents at the same pace, there will be over 1,200 new patents published by the end of 2019. The controversy around patent applications in a sector where open source projects seem to be the norm is likely to remain, but it doesn’t look like this will deter companies or individuals from continuing to safeguard their IP. Perhaps, what’s most telling is that despite the fact that digital currencies and blockchain technology were first designed to circumvent centralized organizations, those very entities are the ones driving patent submissions in an attempt to improve their bottom line.
