As of today, there are about 1,000 contributors onÂ Github. Unique features like Virtual DOM and reusable components grab the attention of front end developers. Despite being just a library for ‘View’ in MVC (Model-View-Controller), it’s giving strong competition to full-blown frameworks like Angular, Meteor, Vue, etc.Â Check out the belo2w graph which shows the trend of popular JS frameworks: Major features of React are listed below: Some of the major advantages of React are: Limitations of React are listed below: JSX is a shorthand for JavaScript XML. This is a type of file used by React which utilizes the expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax. This makes the HTML file really easy to understand. This file makes applications robust and boosts its performance. Below is an example of JSX: Browsers can only read JavaScript objects but JSX in not a regular JavaScript object. Thus to enable a browser to read JSX, first, we need to transform JSX file into a JavaScript object using JSX transformers like Babel and then pass it to the browser. Syntax has changed from ES5 to ES6 in following aspects: Components are the building blocks of a React application’s UI. These components split up the entire UI into small independent and reusable pieces. Then it renders each of these components independent of each other without affecting the rest of the UI. We can embed components into one in the following way: Props is the shorthand for Properties in React. They are read-only components which must be kept pure i.e. immutable. They are always passed down from the parent to the child components throughout the application. A child component can never send a prop back to the parent component. This help in maintaining the unidirectional data flow and are generally used to render the dynamically generated data. State of a component can be updated using this.setState(). There are three different phases of React component’s lifecycle: Some of the most important lifecycle methods are: In React, events are the triggered reactions to specific actions like mouse hover, mouse click, key press, etc.Â Handling these events are similar to handling events in DOM elements. But there are some syntactical differences like: The event argument contains a set of properties, which are specific to an event. Each event type contains its own properties and behavior which can be accessed via its event handler only. Synthetic events are the objects which act as a cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event. They combine the behavior of different browsers into one API. This is done to make sure that the events show consistent properties across different browsers. Following are the cases when refs should be used: We can modularize code by using the export and import properties. They help in writing the components separately in different files. HOC can be used for many tasks like: Following are some of the major problems with MVC framework: Redux is one of the hottest libraries for front-end development in today’s marketplace. It is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications and is used for the entire applications state management. Applications developed with Redux are easy to test and can run in different environments showing consistent behavior. Redux uses ‘Store’ for storing the application’s entireÂ state at one place. So all the component’s state are stored in the Store and they receive updates from the Store itself. The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application. Redux is composed of the following components: Actions in React must have a type property that indicates the type of ACTION being performed. They must be defined as a String constant and you can add more properties to it as well. In Redux, actions are created using the functions called Action Creators. Below is an example of Action and Action Creator: A store is a JavaScript object which can hold the application’s state and provide a few helper methods to access the state, dispatch actions and register listeners. The entire state/ object tree of an application is saved in a single store. As a result of this, Redux is very simple and predictable. We can pass middleware to the store to handle the processing of data as well as to keep a log of various actions that change the state of stores.Â All the actions return a new state via reducers. Advantages of Redux are listed below: React Router is a powerful routing library built on top of React, which helps in adding new screens and flows to the application. This keeps the URL in sync with data thatâs being displayed on the web page.Â It maintains a standardized structure and behavior and is used for developing single page web applications. React Router has a simple API. A Router is used to define multiple routes and when a user types a specific URL, if this URL matches the path of any ârouteâ defined inside the router, then the user is redirected to that particular route. So basically, we need to add a Router library to our app that allows creating multiple routes with each leading to us a unique view.
