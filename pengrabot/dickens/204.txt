Distributed teams, changing business needs, and complex dynamics are redefining the 				workday. Happy Tools makes it possible for your office to run smoothly, no matter what it looks like or 				who makes it go. Instead of having your team work around a strict schedule, get a schedule that works 				around your team. Hit your coverage goals without boxing people into pre-defined work shifts using a clean UI that makes 				fine-tuning easy. Real life happens. Keep it all balanced with a system that accounts for last minute changes and 				scheduling irregularities. When your office is “everywhere”, you need a built-in calendar that covers the work day for your 				distributed team, no matter when that day starts. We built Happy Schedule for ourselves first, and you could say we were happy with the 			result.
