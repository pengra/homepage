In order to be considered for admission, applicants who are current UW students must complete all five prerequisite courses. They mustÂ be completed by the end of winter quarter if you are applying before the April deadline for the autumn admission cycle, or by the end of summer quarter if you are applying before the September deadline for the spring admission cycle. *The course designations given are for courses taken at the UW. However, we are happy to accept non-UW courses.
