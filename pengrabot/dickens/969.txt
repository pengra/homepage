No consensus yet. A more honest script might've supported Reda Kateb's laid-back, medium-effective portrayal of Reinhardt more fully. As is, he's depicted as an artist man floating through his awful times, living for the music. Michael Phillips "Django" will leave fans of the legend merely eager to return to their beloved recordings and let their ears take in the greatness. Robert Abele The film's story - loosely adapted from Alexis Salatko's novel Folles de Django - manages to feel at once oversimplified, underfed and overburdened. Nate Chinen Django is for the most part everything Reinhardt's music was not: listless, glum and meandering. Glenn Kenny Django expresses, via the language of film genre, not what Reinhardt's life was but what it might have felt like. Alan Scherstuhl The finale enlivens an otherwise staid biopic, but whether the film has earned a moment of uplift is unclear. Ben Kenigsberg beautiful and atmospheric Raquel Stecher When music's charms cannot soothe the savage breast S. James Wegg The low-key, languorous pace suits the subject matter if viewers can settle in to a fictionalized story, but one that reminds us of the Romani massacres. Diane Carson It sounds as fresh today as it did in the 1930s. Joe Bendel Great musician; dull, hollow film. David Noh Argues that some Romani music has African foundations. Harvey S. Karten Following a moment in Django Reinhardt's life during World War II, this engaging drama offers us a nuanced portrait of a brilliant musician who gets caught in a very tense situation and begins to slowly realize that he must flee from the dangerous grip of a menacing regime.
