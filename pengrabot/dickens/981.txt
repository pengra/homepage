There are a slew of free or low cost resources out there for Django. Make sure to check the version numbers used in each post you read because Django was released over 10 years ago and has had a huge number of updates since then.

These books and tutorials assume that you know the basics of building Django and want to go further to become much more knowledgeable about the framework.

How do I integrate existing web APIs into my application? I've built a Python web app, now how do I deploy it?
