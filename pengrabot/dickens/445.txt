Advertisement Supported by Federal aviation regulators have allowed the airline industry to have too much power. Mr. Hall was chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board from 1994 to 2001. A new-model airliner crashes, killing all 189 people aboard. Less than five months later, another airliner of the same new model crashes, killing all 157 aboard. Both seem to have occurred under similar circumstances. The world was understandably terrified, and until Wednesday, the United States Federal Aviation Administration stood alone as the only major aviation safety agency that had not ordered the grounding of this airline model, Boeing’s 737 Max 8. They take that responsibility very seriously, and grounding an aircraft is an extreme step rarely taken. Most accidents today do not result from systematic aircraft flaws that would justify grounding an entire fleet. I recommended grounding an airliner model only once in my seven years as chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, following a commuter airliner crash in Indiana. In the end, grounding this aircraft is the right thing to do. It will allow regulators and Boeing’s engineers to determine what exactly caused this crash. The Boeing 737 has been the most successful jet transport ever, with thousands of them serving as the workhorses of the world’s airline industry for half a century. This was thanks to some of the finest aeronautical engineers of their generation, along with a superior aviation safety regulatory system that identified and corrected flaws in technology or operations. The American public should expect no less. The F.A.A. used to lead the world in air safety; today it is bringing up the rear. James E. Hall, a safety and crisis management consultant, was the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board from 1994 to 2001. Advertisement
