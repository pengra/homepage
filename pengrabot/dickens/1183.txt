Advertisement “We are pleased the judge denied Lyft’s motion to block the wage protection rules for now,” Lyft driver and Independent Drivers Guild member Tina Raveneau wrote in a statement to press today. “Eighty thousand New Yorkers serve as professional drivers for apps like Lyft and we deserve the protection and the dignity of a livable minimum wage.” “We support the New York City Council’s minimum earnings goal, but oppose the TLC’s specific rules because they actually hurt earning opportunities for drivers, and provide advantages to certain companies over others,” a Lyft spokesperson wrote to Gizmodo in a statement. “We appreciated the opportunity to make our case in court today, and look forward to the judge’s forthcoming ruling.” Advertisement Updated with statement from Lyft.
