The binary equality operators compare their operands for strict equality or inequality. Equality operators can compare pointers to members of the same type. In such a comparison, pointer-to-member conversions are performed. Pointers to members can also be compared to a constant expression that evaluates to 0. Send feedback about: Loading feedback...
