The right operating system (OS) can make the difference between a functional computer and one in need of an upgrade. Software affects all of a device's processes and can improve its functionality. Every user should work with an OS that they are comfortable with and can navigate easily. Windows 7 has been a popular Windows OS due to its intuitive design, which is much more user-friendly than that of previous generations. On-screen navigation has been simplified with a larger, customizable taskbar, so popular applications can be opened with only a single click. While there are many versions of Windows OS's, the Ultimate version offers increased security and data backup. The OS comes with BitLocker, a hard drive encryption program. Windows 7 Professional offers advanced storage, as well, which prevents unsaved documents from being lost during hardware malfunctions.
