What’s the difference between Main Stage interviews and Q&A Sessions? So glad you asked. Main Stage events occur in the largest auditorium and are live-streamed on TechCrunch.com around the world. Q&A Sessions are specifically for Disrupt SF attendees to extend the conversation with speakers and take place in a smaller, more intimate space. A TechCrunch editor moderates a panel of experts, and they take questions submitted from the audience. It’s the perfect time to take a deeper dive into a topic or to follow-up on an issue raised during a Main Stage or Extra Crunch Stage presentation. Main Stage events are recorded, live-streamed and they’re also available later, on demand — not the case with Q&A Sessions. The only way to benefit from the content is to be there in person. Better plan to arrive early if you want a seat. They’re very popular, space is limited and admission is strictly first come, first served. We’ll have plenty more great programming to share with you soon — new speakers, panels, workshops, sponsored hackathon contests and more.
