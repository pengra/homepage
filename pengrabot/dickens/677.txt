Now, let us discuss about these two state machines one by one. So, based on the present inputs and present states, the Mealy state machine produces outputs. Therefore, the outputs will be valid only at positive (or negative) transition of the clock signal. In general, the number of states required in Mealy state machine is less than or equal to the number of states required in Moore state machine. There is an equivalent Moore state machine for each Mealy state machine. As shown in figure, there are two parts present in Moore state machine. Those are combinational logic and memory. In this case, the present inputs and present states determine the next states. So, based on next states, Moore state machine produces the outputs. Therefore, the outputs will be valid only after transition of the state. In the above figure, there are four states, namely A, B, C & D. These states and the respective outputs are labelled inside the circles. Here, only the input value is labeled on each transition. In the above figure, there are two transitions from each state based on the value of input, x. In general, the number of states required in Moore state machine is more than or equal to the number of states required in Mealy state machine. There is an equivalent Mealy state machine for each Moore state machine. So, based on the requirement we can use one of them. Â© Copyright 2019. All Rights Reserved.
