A 33-year-old dual citizen of Ireland and the United States faces child porn charges in federal court in Maryland as authorities say he helped host and distribute a large number of illegal pornographic files. According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, he was extradited to the United States on Saturday to face federal child pornography charges in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt. He’s been charged with conspiracy to advertise child pornography and conspiracy to distribute child pornography. In a news release,  the office wrote that Marques operated “a free, anonymous web hosting service located on the ‘dark web’ ” from 2008 to 2013 that helped advertise and distribute child pornography. “As of July 12, 2013, one site hosted on the (anonymous web hosting service) reported that there were almost 1.4 million files that were uploaded and accessible by individuals who visit the hidden service,” the office wrote. Marques was ordered to be held before a detention hearing Wednesday in U.S. District Court. No attorney was listed in federal court records as representing Marques. Tor — which provides anonymity to online users by routing users’ traffic through a series of intermediary servers — was initially developed to protect government communications. It’s been a useful way for journalists to communicate with whistleblowers. Marques faces up to 50 years in prison on the two charges. “Today’s extradition of Eric Marques demonstrates that no matter where you are in the world, the FBI and its international law enforcement partners will be diligent in their efforts to hold you accountable for your criminal activity,” FBI Assistant Director Robert Johnson said in a statement. twitter.com/pdavis_llc
