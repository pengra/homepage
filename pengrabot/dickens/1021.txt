This module is always available.  It provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard. The following functions are provided by this module.  Except when explicitly noted otherwise, all return values are floats. New in version 2.6. New in version 2.6. Return an accurate floating point sum of values in the iterable.  Avoids loss of precision by tracking multiple intermediate partial sums: The algorithmâs accuracy depends on IEEE-754 arithmetic guarantees and the typical case where the rounding mode is half-even.  On some non-Windows builds, the underlying C library uses extended precision addition and may occasionally double-round an intermediate sum causing it to be off in its least significant bit. New in version 2.6. New in version 2.6. New in version 2.6. New in version 2.6. New in version 2.7. New in version 2.6. New in version 2.6. New in version 2.6. New in version 2.6. New in version 2.7. New in version 2.7. New in version 2.7. New in version 2.7. The mathematical constant Ï = 3.141592â¦, to available precision. The mathematical constant e = 2.718281â¦, to available precision. Note that Python makes no effort to distinguish signaling NaNs from quiet NaNs, and behavior for signaling NaNs remains unspecified. Typical behavior is to treat all NaNs as though they were quiet.
