Let's improve quality, build after build! Permission prompts are a common sight on the web today. They allow websites to prompt for access to powerful features when needed, giving users granular and contextual choice about what to allow. The permission model has allowed browsers to ship features that would have presented risks to privacy and security otherwise. However, over the last few years the ecosystem has seen a rise in unsolicited, out-of-context permission prompts being put in front of users, particularly ones that ask for permission to send push notifications. In the interest of protecting our users and the web platform from this, we plan to experiment with restricting how and when websites can ask for notification permissions. Push notifications are a powerful capability that enables new kinds of interactions with sites. It is hard to imagine a modern chat or social networking app that doesn’t send notifications. Since notifications can be sent after you leave a site, it is only natural that a site would need to ask for permission to show them. Looks familiar? This leads us to believe that We suspect that these numbers might not paint a full picture of the resulting user experience, and we would like to get a real world impression of how requiring user interaction for notification permission prompts affects sites in the wild. In the first two weeks of this experiment, Firefox will not show any user-facing notifications when the restriction is applied to a website. In the last two weeks of this experiment, Firefox will show an animated icon in the address bar (where our notification prompt normally would appear) when this restriction is applied. If the user clicks on the icon, they will be presented with the prompt at that time. Prototype of new prompt without user interaction We suspect that requiring user interaction is not a perfect solution to this problem. To get to a better approach, we need to find out more about how our release user population interacts with permission prompts. Hence, we are planning to launch a short-running experiment in Firefox Release 67 to gather information about the circumstances in which users interact with permission prompts. Have they been on the site for a long time? Have they rejected a lot of permission prompts before? The goal is to collect a set of possible heuristics for future permission prompt restrictions. At Mozilla, this sort of data collection on a release channel is an exception to the rule, and requires strict data review. The experiment will run for a limited time, with a small percentage of our release user population. Web developers should anticipate that Firefox and other browsers may in the future decide to reject a website’s permission request based on automatically determined heuristics. As a general principle, prompting for permissions should be done based on user interaction. Offering your users additional context, and delaying the prompt until the user chooses to show it, will not only future-proof your site, but likely also increase your user engagement and prompt acceptance rates.
