They say there's more than one archive node, and other types of nodes keep records too At a high level, archive nodes store Ethereum snapshots. Not just a record of all the transactions processed, but a complete map of the entire blockchain each time a block is added. They are different to full nodes, which are just concerned with transactions, not states. According to BlockCypher’s blog, rebooting archive nodes is supremely difficult – so much so that literally nobody else is bothering to run them, which the company says could present a security risk. It then declared a lesson learned: BlockCypher might be the only ones keeping an “entire history of Ethereum transactions.” This might be a problem, especially in scenarios where the blockchain is under attack. But according to the Ethereum insiders Hard Fork spoke with, BlockCypher’s concerns don’t necessarily represent the true nature of the network, as archive nodes have no bearing on its overall security. Infura co-founder E.G. Galano told Hard Fork that archive nodes are only necessary in certain circumstances. In particular, they are used to check the state of an Ethereum account at any given block height. Other than that specific use, he claims there is no real need to keep them around. “For example, if you wanted to know the Ether balance an account had at block #4,000,000, you would need to run and query an archive node,” Galano explained. “They are use case dependent and have no impact on the security or trust model of the blockchain.” To be clear: Ethereum‘s archive nodes are not equivalent to full nodes. A full node stores transaction history. An archive node stores that, as well as additional data related to Ethereum‘s state. Galano expressed that full nodes propagate the exact same information across Ethereum as archive nodes. In this case, the “archive label” simply means it computes and stores additional blockchain-derived data to query information more efficiently. “It is full nodes that are the key to maintaining and synchronizing the Ethereum blockchain, including all transactions and state transitions,” said Swende. “A ‘full node‘ is a node which has performed a fast-sync or a so-called full-sync. If the node additionally stores a snapshot of each state at every block, then it is commonly referred to as an ‘archive node.'” He then confirmed the three types of Ethereum nodes (fast-sync, full-sync, and archive) all keep the required data necessary to replay (or restore) all chain events, not just archive nodes. The only data stored by archive nodes (and not by the others) is the full history of Ethereum states, which can be derived using data stored in other nodes anyway. Just like Infura and the Ethereum Foundation, Parity’s technology chief Fredrik Harrysson isn’t quite convinced of BlockCypher’s claims. Infura’s Galano sided with Harrysson. “BlockCypher is not the only one running archive nodes. We run many, as do other API and infrastructure providers,” he told Hard Fork. “I don’t know the number that the Ethereum Foundation runs, but they at least run a few for their own use.” The crux of BlockCypher’s blog was that it took more than two weeks to ‘reboot’ their version of Ethereum stored by their archive node. It also emphasized Ethereum‘s “state” is very different to other blockchains, in that it cannot be restored using any traditional backup method. “Everyone makes mistakes and we ran into similar issues earlier in the life of Infura. My issue with that blog post is not that it says running an archive node is resource intensive, it is,” Galano admitted. “My issue is that if you are trusted to run infrastructure as a service and issue a post-mortem, take responsibility for your failures and don’t blame the protocol that your users expect you to understand better than they do.” “A reasonable lower-bounded number of nodes required is debatable – essentially if one trusted party had and served all the history it would be fine, but we’d be relying on a centralised party not disappearing, which thankfully is not the case here,” concluded Harrysson. Archive nodes might not be considered strict requirements for Ethereum to operate securely, but as it turns out, they aren’t as rare as they seem, even despite their apparent lack of utility.
