A Turing machine is a theoretical machine that manipulates symbols on a tape strip, based on a table of rules. Even though the Turing machine is simple, it can be tailored to replicate the logic associated with any computer algorithm. It is also particularly useful for describing the CPU functions within a computer. Alan Turing invented the Turing machine in 1936, and he referred to it as an "a-machine" or automatic machine. The Turing machine is not intended to be a functional computing technology; instead, it is intended as a hypothetical machine that represents a computing machine. The Turing machine can help computer scientists comprehend the boundaries of mechanical computation. Turing machines mathematically model a device that mechanically runs using a tape. This tape includes symbols, which the machine can write and read, one after the other, with the help of a tape head. More specifically, a Turing machine includes the following: Join nearly 200,000 subscribers who receive actionable tech insights from Techopedia.
