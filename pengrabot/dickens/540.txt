JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities. Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser. It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content. The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field. The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server. JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly. The merits of using JavaScript are − We cannot treat JavaScript as a full-fledged programming language. It lacks the following important features − Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason. JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available. JavaScript doesn't have any multi-threading or multiprocessor capabilities. Once again, JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages. One of major strengths of JavaScript is that it does not require expensive development tools. You can start with a simple text editor such as Notepad. Since it is an interpreted language inside the context of a web browser, you don't even need to buy a compiler. To make our life simpler, various vendors have come up with very nice JavaScript editing tools. Some of them are listed here − The ECMAScript Edition 5 standard will be the first update to be released in over four years. JavaScript 2.0 conforms to Edition 5 of the ECMAScript standard, and the difference between the two is extremely minor. Today, Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript conform to the ECMAScript standard, although both the languages still support the features that are not a part of the standard. © Copyright 2019.
