Turing Machine was invented by Alan Turing in 1936 and it is used to accept Recursive Enumerable Languages (generated by Type-0 Grammar). Let us construct a turing machine for L={0n1n|n>=1} Illustration Let us see how this turing machine works for 0011. Initially head points to 0 which is underlined and state is q0 as: Note: The table is interpreted as illustrated below. The entry (q1, 1, R) in row q0 and column 1 signifies that if M is in state q0 and reads 1 on the current tape square, then it writes 1 on the same tape square, moves its tape head one position to the right and transitions to state q1. Which of the following statements is true about M? Solution:  Let us see whether machine halts on string ‘1’. Initially state will be q0, head will point to 1 as: It will run in the same way again and again and not halt. Option D says M halts on all string ending with 1, but it is not halting for 1. So, option D is incorrect. Let us see whether machine halts on string ‘0’. Initially state will be q0, head will point to 1 as: It will run in the same way again and again and not halt. Option C says M halts on all string ending with 0, but it is not halting for 0. So, option C is incorrect. Option B says that TM does not halt for any string (00 + 1)*. But NULL string is a part of (00 + 1)* and TM will halt for NULL string. For NULL string, tape will be,
