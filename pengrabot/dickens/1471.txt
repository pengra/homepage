There are many Emacs packages and modules for Haskell. The most prominent ones are haskell-mode, ghc-mod and Scion. Emacs is an extensible texteditor which can be extended with so-called "modes" and makes great use of keystrokes. Modes are written in Emacs Lisp (.el) programming language and provide additional commands and keystrokes. A mode is usually activated automatically via "hooks" based on file extensions (.hs, .cabal etc.) but can also be loaded during Emacs startup (~/.emacs) or in Emacs itself (enter: M-x haskell-mode). None of the modes listed below provide a complete out-of-the-box IDE; rather, each adds only a set of functionality specific to that mode. Note also that each mode must be installed separately. Lookup the specific help files to find out what each of them provide. To test if haskell-mode is actually installed type: M-x haskell-<tab>. You should get a list of commands. Entering "haskell-mode" provides additional commands. Try "haskell-version" for example. Documentation on how to use `scion.el` can be found in the `README.markdown` file. "ghc-mod" is a backend command to enrich Haskell programming on editors including Emacs and Vim. The ghc-mod package on Hackage includes the "ghc-mod" command and Emacs front-end. Its source repository is on github. Emacs front-end is an extension of Haskell mode. They enable to complete Haskell symbols on Emacs and to browse documents of modules. Flymake with GHC/Hlint is also integrated.
