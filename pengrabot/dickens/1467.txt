Macros are useful for performing repetitive actions in Emacs. A macro is just a recording of a previous set of keystrokes that can be replayed to perform future actions. Emacs, like any powerful tool, takes significant intentional practice to use properly. These resources provide instructions for becoming comfortable with the editor itself rather than specific Python environment configuration advice. Emacs can be completely customized and rewritten by using the Emacs-specific Lisp programming language named Emacs Lisp (Elisp). The ability to completely modify the editor is part of what led to the old joke "a great operating system, lacking only a decent editor". Nevertheless, Elisp is what gives Emacs its text editing power despite the perception that the editor is overkill for working with text. These tutorials will help you learn the Elisp language and use it to modify Emacs for your own purposes. Numerous custom Emacs user configurations exist that bundle together custom Elisp packages and libraries to handle creating a powerful integrated development environment. I recommend trying to configure Emacs yourself before you dive into any of these configurations so it is easier to learn base Emacs rather than get distracted by the customizations. Tell me about using the Vim editor for Python development. I want to learn how to code a Python web application using a framework. I want to know about working with data in Python.
