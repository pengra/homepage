Q&A for work. A dedicated place to share your teamâ€™s knowledge. original string is "a,d,k" I want to remove all "," and make it to "adk".  I tried: "a,d,k".replace(/,/,"") but it doesn't work. Thanks in advance. You aren't assigning the result of the replace method back to your variable. When you call replace, it returns a new string without modifying the old one. For example, load this into your favorite browser: You can try something like: If U want to delete more than one characters, say comma and dots you can write <script type="text/javascript">var s = '/Controller/Action#11112';if(typeof s == 'string' && /\?*/.test(s)){s = s.replace(/\#.*/gi,'');}document.write(s);</script> Here the script that can remove up to 12 commas: Modify that for loop if you need bigger numbers.
