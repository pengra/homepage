In the last century, we greatly expanded the notion of what it means to be human. Remarkable innovations in both science and technology brought us to the moon, laid the foundation of the Internet, and cured many of the most pressing diseases that plagued us. What’s next? To further explore our boundaries, we need the next generation of technologies that can read and write from the most powerful tool we have—the human brain. At Kernel, we are building a non-invasive mind/body/machine interface (MBMI) to radically improve and expand human cognition. We are a team of neuroscientists, physicists, mathematicians, and hardware and software engineers driven by the belief that exploring the brain is the most urgent and important challenge of this century. We are building on two decades of breakthrough research to make the future of neuroscience possible.
