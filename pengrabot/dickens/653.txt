In some finite-state machine representations, it is also possible to associate actions with a state: There are a large number of variants to represent an FSM such as the one in figure 3. The start state can also be an accepting state, in which case the automaton accepts the empty string. In control applications, two types are distinguished: In accordance with the general classification, the following formal definitions are found: The following concepts are commonly used to build software applications with finite state machines:
