This Java tutorial trail (set of articles) describes the Java programming language. The intention of this tutorial     is mostly to be a compressed introduction to Java for developers who already know a bit about programming and 	object oriented concepts. I will try to explain the various different concepts as I use them, but a bit of programming     background will helpful. The target audience for this Java tutorial is both beginners who need to learn Java almost from scratch, and     more experienced developers who just need to catch up on features they haven't used. This Java tutorial covers the following Java topics: The Java language and platform is constantly evolving. New versions of Java are now released approximately every     6 months. I will update this tutorial with the latest features as fast as I am able to. If you are just looking for what is new in each Java version, the following sections will list the main     additions to the latest Java versions. The main additions to Java 12 are: The main additions to Java 11 are: The main additions to Java 10 are: The main additions to Java 9 are: The main additions to Java 8 are: The main new features in Java 7 are: As you read the tutorials I would recommend that you play around with code examples etc. Personally, I learn better     when I type in examples and run them. In order to do this, you need to: The easiest way to do these three steps is to use a Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment). You can edit     the Java code, compile it and execute it, all from within the IDE. There are three popular Java IDE's available: Both Eclipse and Netbeans are free, and IntelliJ IDEA has a free community edition which is just fine when you     start learning Java. Personally I use IntelliJ IDEA, but I have used all three IDEs from time to time. All of     them will be fine for you to start out with. Jakob Jenkov
