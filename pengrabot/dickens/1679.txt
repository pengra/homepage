Tampa Weather Summary: 67 degrees PLANT CITY, Fla. â€” When a woman found a camera she hadn't seen before, she contacted her cable and internet provider to find out who it belonged to and why it was there. She probably didn't expect that camera would help deputies find a man's child porn stash. The woman found the spycam on March 5. Her internet provider found it was linked to her home Wifi without her consent or knowledge. Detectives interviewed Terry Sumner, 55, who the victim says had full access to the home, Wifi password and alarm code. Detectives say he admitted to putting the spy camera in the victim's home about a year before. He told detectives he had been using a smartphone app on his phone to watch, listen and record activity at the home via a live feed. Deputies issued a search warrant to gain access to Sumner's phone where they say they found hundreds of videos of the inside of the home and "numerous" pictures of child porn. The victims pictured in the photos were known to Sumner and were all under 11, according to deputies. He was arrested and charged with one count of interception of wire, oral or electronic communications, 24 counts of child porn possession, 24 counts of manufacturing child porn, one count of lewd and lascivious molestation force or enticing, one count of lewd and lascivious exhibition, and one count of capital sexual battery.
