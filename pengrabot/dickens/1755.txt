A single API can have multiple implementations (or none, being abstract) in the form of different libraries that share the same programming interface. API documentation describes what services an API offers and how to use those services, aiming to cover everything a client would need to know for practical purposes. In the interest of clarity, API documentation may include a description of classes and methods in the API as well as "typical usage scenarios, code snippets, design rationales, performance discussions, and contracts", but implementation details of the API services themselves are usually omitted.
