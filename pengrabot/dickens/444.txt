SpaceX was not the first to do vertical landing of a rocket. Yes, SpaceX is awesome :) I follow their progress closely. Any company that aims to push the frontier forward in Space is awesome. Seems like a really small rocket, a bit like the grasshopper. What I'm wondering is how deep that engine throttles and whether the plan is to copy SpaceX and use a cluster of 9. Thomas Sesselmann Retweeted Linkspace Thomas Sesselmann added, They had better work on some serious deep throttling capability then. The post doesn't even say "made history".......... The video does... i stand corrected, but i just don't support bashing new companies for doing something awesome Very nice technical milestone. Congrats! If only I had such throttling capabilities... awesome. Congrats Nice work! Can't wait to see your rockets reaching orbit! That is super promising. Much sooner than we think the market of reusable rockets will shift the paradigms  Back to top ↑
