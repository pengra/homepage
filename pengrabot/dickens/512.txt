Now, let us move ahead in this Java Tutorial blog, where we will understand each aspect of Java in the following sequence: Next, let us understand different member variables in Java.Â Let me discuss about each one of them: In the above code, ‘color’ is my instance variable which has a value “black” associated to it. All cars must be having 4 tyres, right? So in my above code, I have declared a static variable as ‘tyre’ whose valueÂ remains same throughout the class. Let’s move ahead in this Java Tutorial blogÂ and look at our next topic i.e data types and operators in Java. As you can see in the above image,Â data types are of 4 major types. Letâs move forward and look at the various data operations whichÂ you can perform in Java. There areÂ mainly 4 different types of operators, which are listed below: Meanwhile, you may go through this Java Tutorial video where all the concepts related to Java has been clearly explained using example: Lets see these control statements one by one. Now these statements can be further classified into the following: Refer to the following flowchart to get a better understanding of if-else statements: In this flowchart, the code will respond in the following way: Here you must have got an idea of how these if-else statements work. Now, how can we use these statements in Eclipse IDE? Letâs have a look at the code: In the above code, I have created a class Compare where I have compared two numbers ‘a’ and ‘b’. First of all, it will go in ‘if’ condition where it checks whether the value of ‘a’ is greater than ‘b’ or not. If the condition is true, it will print “A is greater than B” else it will execute “B is greater”. Refer to the following flowchart to get a better understanding of switch statements: In the above code, I have created a class SwitchExample which has 3 cases that print days of a week. It also has a default case which is executed whenever a user doesn’t specify a case. Concluding both of the selection statements, we understood that if we are comparing two statements, we are using if-else, but letâs say if you are checking a specific value against a particular statement, then we are going for the Switch statement. Next, there is another set of control statements, i.e Iteration Statements. Let’s understand each one of them in detail: Now, let us see how you can implement the code in IDE.Â In the above code, it first checks the condition whether the value of a is less than 10 or not. Here, the value of a is 5 which in turn satisfy the condition, and thusÂ perform functions. In this do-while flowchart, the code will respond in the following steps: Let’s see how you can implement the code in IDE. In the above code, it will first execute the ‘do’ statements and then jump to the while part. In this program, the output would be : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. Let’s see how you can implement the code in IDE. In the above code, it will directly print the numbers from 1 to 10. Letâs learn aboutÂ them in detail: The syntax for this statement is just the âbreakâ keyword followed by a semicolon. In this flowchart, the code will respond in the following steps: If the loop condition is false, it directly exits the loop. If the loop condition is true, it will execute block 1 statements. After that it will check for ‘continue’ statement.Â If it is present, then the statements after that will not be executed in the same iteration of the loop. If Â ‘continue’ statement is not present, then all the statements after that will be executed. Learn Java From Experts A class in Java is a blueprint which includes all your data.Â  A class contain fields(variables) andÂ methodsÂ to describe the behavior of an object. Let’s have a look at the syntax of a class. Want to know more about them? I would suggest you to see this Java class video which will take you through in-depth details of Java classes and the different key-components in Java. Go ahead, enjoy the video and tell me what you think. Next, let us move ahead in our Java Tutorial blogÂ where we’ll be discussing about another key concept i.e. Arrays. There areÂ two types of arrays in Java: int a[] = new int[12]; int table[][]= new int[4][5]; It is quite similar to the matrix that we use in mathematics. Refer to the below image where I have stored data with respect to different dimensions. Let’s see the below code to understand the concept of array in Java. Till now, we have learned about member variables, data types, control statements, classes and objects. Let’s see how all of them are structured together in a class in Java. Finally, we come to our last topic in Java Tutorial blogÂ i.e Object Oriented programming concepts. We have already discussed about classes and objects in Java. Letâs discuss the 4 main concepts of object oriented programming – Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism and Abstraction. Letâs begin with the first concept i.e. Inheritance. In the above image, Animal is the superclass whereas amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds are your child classes which are inheriting the properties from ‘Animal’ class. Check Out Java Course OR
