The world's premier e-print repository in physics, math, computer science and related disciplines enabling scientists worldwide to share and access research before it is formally published.  Cornell University Library has provided operational support and stewardship for this open-access service since 2001. A planning grant from the Simons Foundation facilitated the development of a sustainability model with input from a wide range of stakeholders to position arXiv as a collaboratively governed, community-supported resource and to strengthen arXiv's technical, service, financial and policy infrastructure,  The Simons Foundation has also provided funding to encourage matching institutional contributions. http://arxiv.org Feedback Give to the Library
