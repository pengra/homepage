While the Linux kernel contains code for all the different chip architectures and hardware drivers it supports, an individual system runs only a fraction of the codebase. An average laptop uses around 2 million lines of kernel code from 5 thousand files to function properly, while the Pixel phone uses 3.2 million lines of kernel code from 6 thousand files (due to the increased complexity of an SoC). The numbering of the kernel releases began at 2.6.x, where x was an incrementing number that changed on every release (the value of the number has no meaning, other than it is newer than the previous kernel release). The kernel version since then has now moved to 4.x accounting for 2 major version changes. These version numbers are chosen by the maintainer(s) only to avoid confusion among users caused by higher minor release numbers.
