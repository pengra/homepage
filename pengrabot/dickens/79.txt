JIRA Jr. is the best way to track being a kid. Track baseball cards, tea parties, boo-boos, poo-poos, and more. No more sticky-stars on the fridge. Drag-and-drop your tasks and tell your parents to watch your burndown. Don't know what "component" means? Then just call it "stuff." It's like drawing on the wall with Crayons. Show your friends you mean business, and keep your Lego projects on schedule. Make JIRA Jr. your own with custom plugins and all sorts of crazy. Okay, not yet. But we're working on it.
