The original shoe worn by Musk was commissioned by a “close friend” of Musk’s and a Tesla investor, Acosta Jr said. The bad news for sneaker and Tesla aficionados: the Limited Edition pairs are already sold out. Acosta has received hundreds of inquiries so far. But don’t despair, DM Custom Sneakers plans to make more of Tesla-logoed shoes. The next batch won’t be “limited editions” Acosta says, although they’ll cost the same since the same materials will be used. Customers can reach Acosta through the company’s Instagram account or via email at: https://www.dmcustomsneakers.com/. The popularity of the sneakers is just the latest example of the fascination and fervor that surrounds Musk and Tesla, regardless of headwinds or controversies that continue to pop up.
