You'll hear the word tossed around by many a political pundit, but you may still wonder: What is gerrymandering? We're here to help. On the national level, it all begins with the U.S. Census. The census is taken every 10 years, recording populationÂ shifts around the country. It's used to determine how many congressional representatives each state gets of the total 435.
