Value-at-Risk Second Edition – by Glyn A. Holton  Newton’s method is a numerical technique for solving equations of the form [2.136] [2.137] [2.138] [2.139] [2.140] This is illustrated in Exhibit 2.16. [2.141] [2.142] This is the general recursive formula for the univariate Newton’s method. Consider the equation [2.143] In this case, [2.144] and [2.145] [2.146] [2.147] [2.148] Solution Solution  Send this to a friend
