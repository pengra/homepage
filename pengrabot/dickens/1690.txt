Caption Close STAMFORD — A Stamford man was arrested over the weekend for publishing a nude picture of his ex-girlfriend on social media. Christopher Rodriguez, 20, of Dolson Place, was charged with unlawful dissemination of an intimate image and released after posting a $15,000 court-appearance bond. In early January, police were called to speak to a young woman complaining about a nude picture of her appearing on Snapchat. The day before the woman said she was with a male friend when he noticed a group chat with his peers talking about a picture that had just been uploaded, a police report of the incident says. The woman said although her face could not be seen, the picture was one taken by her ex-boyfriend Rodriguez while laying his face on her naked buttocks. The woman explained that she and Rodriguez had gone out for two years since after meeting at the Academy of Information Technology and Engineering in Stamford. The woman said she was sure the picture was of her because a birthmark on her left butt cheek could clearly be seen in the picture, Rodriguez’s five-page arrest affidavit said. The woman said she immediately called Rodriguez and began screaming at him. Rodriguez said that he did not mean to upload the picture onto Snapchat, but was instead trying to send it to another friend. The woman said Rodriguez refused to be serious during the call and even told her that her breasts were all over Twitter, a claim that proved not to be true, according to the affidavit. When Rodriguez talked to police, he admitted that publishing the picture was a mistake and that was something he did not intend to do. But he also said the taking of the picture, sometime in 2017, was completely consensual. Rodriguez also showed police a text where he apologized for any embarrassment he caused the victim. jnickerson@stamfordadvocate.com
